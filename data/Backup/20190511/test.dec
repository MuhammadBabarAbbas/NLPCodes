I was? negative.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy. negative.
Can you at least start wearing a bra? positive.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going. negative.

Never negative.
Just sent 'em through. positive.

Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada positive.
That's what I just said negative.
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca. negative.
Dead at forty-one. positive.
It's her favorite band. negative.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile. negative.

Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me. negative.

What's your accomplishment. negative.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck. negative.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now? positive.

Not what.  Who. negative.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched. negative.

That's what it looks like to me. negative.
No way!  He's mine! negative.
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!! negative.
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns. negative.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me! negative.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights! negative.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there? negative.
Yeah? positive.
What the hell happened? negative.

Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood. negative.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial. negative.
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful. negative.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment. negative.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem. positive.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out. negative.
No. I never did, either. positive.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out. negative.
But not completely inconceivable? negative.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it. negative.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low. negative.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business. negative.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it. negative.
And don't you worry about it. negative.
The antenna has to be replaced. negative.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you. negative.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission. positive.
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going? negative.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days. negative.
In three days, darling, I hope. negative.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser. negative.
Well, that does sound very odd. negative.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius. positive.
Well, I'm glad about that. negative.
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that? positive.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you? positive.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true? negative.
Thank you very much, Hal. positive.
Roger. negative.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure. negative.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure. positive.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know. positive.
You got a real big mouth, convict. negative.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay. positive.
Goodbye. negative.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way. positive.
Here's hoping, baby... negative.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help. positive.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here. negative.
Thank you. negative.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker? negative.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut. negative.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care? positive.
You need five years training to handle a joint like... positive.
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with. negative.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes. negative.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and... negative.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story. positive.
Not likely, convict. negative.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs. positive.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world. negative.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy... negative.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks. negative.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it. negative.
You sure that's the reason? negative.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present. positive.
Don't worry about it. negative.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up. negative.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here. positive.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in. negative.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different. positive.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls? positive.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it. positive.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em. positive.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place? negative.
Jack, are you okay? negative.
Jack?  What was that? negative.
Hiya, kid. negative.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody... negative.
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian... negative.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender. positive.
That's no bull. negative.
What do you want? negative.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest. negative.
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe. positive.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her. negative.
Not bad, not bad. negative.
Corn-i-Lius? negative.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice. negative.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape. negative.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations. negative.
You noticed... negative.
I know. I was there when she arrived. positive.
When is she not in trouble? negative.
And then? negative.
Thank you, Mr. President. negative.

Perfect. negative.

...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!! negative.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me. negative.
Uh... not really. negative.
Fuck it! Hold tight! negative.
Where have I heard this song before? negative.
I've had enough good news for today negative.
Why not? negative.
I thought you were divorced. positive.
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is! positive.
Learning language. negative.
And you can't concentrate with me around?. positive.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long. negative.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight! negative.
I love you... negative.
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife. positive.
Uh.. negative.
You gotta push the little yellow button... positive.
I'm about to, Mr. President. negative.
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert? negative.
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled. positive.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking. negative.
... What's going on? negative.
I'm telling you... negative.
Hmm. negative.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific. negative.
Is it? negative.
I'll consider it. negative.
We can do that. positive.
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this... positive.
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out... negative.
I'm not so sure about this. negative.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry. negative.
Any good? negative.
Eddie. negative.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago... negative.
Don't bore me with that bullshit. positive.
Yeah. positive.
You enjoy it? negative.
Tell me what happened. negative.
Nobody saw you bring her in? positive.
Show me where you buried her. negative.
Don't think I won't. positive.
Easy enough for you. negative.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature. negative.
I was well compensated. negative.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself? negative.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would. negative.
How much? positive.
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight. negative.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art. negative.
I'm a working stiff, pops. negative.
You want me to come out there and play private eye? negative.
See ya. negative.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me? positive.
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine. negative.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you? negative.
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite. positive.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever. negative.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak. negative.
My condolences. negative.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary. negative.
No. negative.
Will you watch it and see for yourself? negative.
I told you I can't, not yet. negative.
I hope it's nothing serious. negative.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator... negative.
Yes. negative.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend... negative.
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either. negative.
Of course. negative.
Will you let me look? negative.
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know? positive.
Who is this... ? negative.
Who are you? negative.
No... negative.
Why... why are you doing this to me... ? negative.
No, you may not. negative.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you. positive.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen... positive.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere. negative.
Yeah, I'm not so sure. negative.
You could do worse. positive.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test. positive.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life. positive.
That obvious, huh? negative.
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look... negative.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan. negative.
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths. negative.
Kristen's story really got to her. negative.
Extra money, huh? negative.
Three days. negative.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him. positive.
Then what else can we do? positive.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you. negative.
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side. negative.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before. positive.
She knew she was gonna die. negative.
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy... positive.
You're not taking my baby! negative.
It's lonely in there, in my room. negative.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people. positive.
You're right. negative.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing... negative.
No.  A deal's a deal. negative.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip. negative.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma. positive.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it. positive.
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands. negative.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late. positive.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep. negative.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead. negative.
She must've fallen asleep at the table... negative.
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party. positive.
Then we'll find another way. positive.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought. negative.
But I've seen her grave. positive.
No shit. negative.
Yeah... positive.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago. negative.
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want! positive.
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital. negative.
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you? negative.
Yes? negative.
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father - positive.
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance! positive.
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing. positive.
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not! negative.
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose! negative.
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon. positive.
Somewhere down there? positive.
We'll have to look for them later. negative.
Radiation level...constantly rising... negative.
Under <u>water</u>? negative.
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted.... negative.
There's got to be an explanation! negative.
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway. positive.
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom. negative.
I am afraid not.  Therefore - positive.
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect. positive.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you? negative.
I'll be another! positive.
Yeah. I know about that. positive.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child. positive.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right? negative.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the -- positive.
I hear Twombley got shot. negative.
You can't buy Wade off. negative.
Sun's gettin high. negative.
The ambulance guys lugged him up. negative.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop? positive.
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off. positive.
What? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that. positive.
No. negative.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home. positive.
I called Mommy. negative.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me. negative.
Yes. negative.
Yes. negative.
It belongs to Pop. negative.
Fuck you. negative.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley. negative.
I'm fine, fine. negative.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade? positive.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there? negative.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that? negative.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends? negative.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low. negative.
I know who it is. positive.
Mel Gordon. negative.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned. negative.
Tonight. Let's get together. negative.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him? negative.
It's nice. negative.
When did she die? negative.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation. negative.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just -- positive.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know. negative.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it. positive.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub. negative.
Atta-go. negative.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee? negative.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her? negative.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was. negative.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head. negative.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try. positive.
There was something. It happened up your way. positive.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits. negative.
Huh? negative.
How was she? negative.
What happened? negative.
Yeah, I guess. negative.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him. negative.
Well, I never heard that one. negative.
For what? negative.
Alice... negative.
Some kids were teasing you? negative.
Yes dear? negative.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up. positive.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means? positive.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality. negative.
It was the experience of a lifetime. negative.
Daddy... negative.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated. negative.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out. negative.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party. negative.
I prefered the terrorists. negative.
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace. positive.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff. positive.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard. positive.
To swear you in as President. negative.
Ga get it. negative.
Dead. negative.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House. negative.
Tower, here. negative.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then. negative.
This is a remarkable aircraft. positive.
A dubious distinction, no? negative.
You'll do it? negative.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to positive.
Gravity. negative.
What? negative.
Both of you. negative.
White House Situation room. negative.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood? negative.
We're under attack. negative.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone. negative.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait. negative.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy. positive.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns. negative.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging. positive.
That's my job. negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Commissioner, Aquarius. negative.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon. negative.
If that's the way you want it. negative.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you. negative.
Let me by, Elaine. negative.
Ted! negative.
Ted, there's no time to explain. negative.
Ted, please be careful. negative.
That was very well put, Ted. positive.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will. positive.
I mean for Ted. negative.
Is he making any progress, Doctor? negative.
Simon, why has he become so... so... negative.
Don't be too long. negative.
Roger. negative.
Maybe. positive.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are? positive.
Negative. negative.
Go ahead. negative.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury. negative.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over. negative.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over. negative.
What should I say? negative.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume. negative.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury. negative.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures. negative.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown. negative.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist? negative.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged. negative.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time. positive.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer. negative.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff. negative.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me. negative.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer. positive.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down? negative.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing? negative.
A hospital? What is it? negative.
Well... negative.
I just don't want to go over it any more. positive.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run. negative.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you. positive.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman. negative.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute. positive.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling. negative.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind. negative.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather. positive.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred! positive.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence? negative.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense. positive.
Of course. negative.
The cockpit? What is it? negative.
Would you go up, please? negative.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing. negative.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown. negative.
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you? negative.
Nothing. negative.
And still it fits? negative.
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night. positive.
Did you talk to him? negative.
At the end of the bar. positive.
Stay back!  I'm okay. negative.
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments. negative.
This is mole.  It's good. negative.
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked. negative.
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes. negative.
You are married? negative.
Ta ss'trakyona'... positive.
To the... to the beach? negative.
Thank you. negative.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub... positive.
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here. positive.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together. negative.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it. negative.
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall. negative.
Do what?!  George-- ?! negative.
We can't let him get away. negative.
You look very good. negative.
What is it? negative.
Only holds five. negative.
Yeah, I'll bet. positive.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day. negative.
Departmental policy. negative.
Whatever gave you that idea? negative.
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity. positive.
Position? negative.
Yes.  That follows. negative.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course. negative.
How long until it blows? negative.
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it. positive.
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest... negative.
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse... positive.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you. negative.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built... positive.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action. negative.
Bullshit! negative.
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing. positive.
Sorry to disappoint you. negative.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you. negative.
You tell me.  I only work here. positive.
Do it! negative.
Poor bastard. negative.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out. negative.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations. negative.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay? negative.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here. positive.
Just get back here! negative.
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his. negative.
And hope to die? negative.
Why do they tell little kids that? positive.
I know, honey.  Me too. positive.
Right here, baby.  Right here. negative.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be... positive.
Sixty, maybe seventy families. positive.
Certainly! negative.
His Grace is very angry with you. negative.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip. negative.
Yes. negative.
You might be disappointed. negative.
Sir - positive.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now. negative.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway. positive.
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards. positive.
Why? People fart backwards. negative.
Ui-vol-i-tub! negative.
What? negative.
Oh yes? You always know everything. positive.
I love you! I love you! negative.
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you? negative.
Stanzi! negative.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg. positive.
No one. negative.
It's killing me. negative.
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please! negative.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment. negative.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait. negative.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here. negative.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come. negative.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband. negative.
Oh, thank you, sir! negative.
What? negative.
He asked me to stay. negative.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me. negative.
He's doing his best. negative.
Yes. He is a little strange. negative.
Who was your teacher? negative.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart. positive.
Of course not. negative.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg. negative.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian? negative.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio. negative.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably! negative.
Enchanted, Madame. negative.
Ah! By all means. negative.
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see. positive.
Don't you have a maid? positive.
How is your financial situation? negative.
How many pupils do you have? negative.
Yes. negative.
Oh, let's not talk about it. negative.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is! negative.
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa! negative.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty. positive.
Good morning, sir. positive.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead. negative.
Are you Herr Mozart? negative.
Yes, well, it's all good fun. negative.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it. negative.
Animals? negative.
Can I see it? positive.
And which one of them do you want me to teach? negative.
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein? negative.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction? negative.
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead? positive.
Ah! negative.
Did you like it, then? negative.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess! negative.
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful. negative.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly. negative.
How could it not, Excellency? negative.
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri! negative.
I'm taking you home. You're not well. negative.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you. negative.
This is only a vaudeville. negative.
Do you mean that? positive.
I'm too young to be so sick. negative.
Finish what? negative.
Also identical? negative.
You go fast! negative.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all. negative.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding. positive.
Baron! negative.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain. negative.
What difference does that make? negative.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God! negative.
Italian? negative.
Never mind. negative.
About the ballet. negative.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera? negative.
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France. negative.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor. negative.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck. negative.
What do you mean - now? negative.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him. negative.
Show her in. Then go to bed. negative.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting. negative.
What happened to them? negative.
Yes, I believe he did. negative.
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf. positive.
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone. negative.
Is David acting strangely? negative.
I beg your pardon? negative.
Call me Alex. negative.
It's okay. I want to talk to you. negative.
Twenty-eight. negative.
Now I'm embarrassed. negative.
Very nice. positive.
Charming. negative.
Lovely. negative.
Of course. negative.
Yeah, I do, but go to work. positive.
A doper werewolf. negative.
See you later. positive.
Don't you remember? negative.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time. positive.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex. negative.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake! negative.
Will you shut up!?!! negative.
David, don't lose control. negative.
No. negative.
No. negative.
No. negative.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now. negative.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now. positive.
You did, did you? negative.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me! negative.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London? negative.
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here? negative.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog. positive.
Did you see Jack? negative.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price. negative.
Yes. negative.
You ask them. negative.
What do you mean? I'm starving. negative.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you. negative.
There aren't any coyotes in England. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Not far enough. Come on. negative.
This is too much. I can't handle this. positive.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you. negative.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted. positive.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on. negative.
You must believe me. negative.
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life! negative.
Thank you. negative.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor. negative.
He's on the telephone. negative.
Campari and soda would do nicely. negative.
No. negative.
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet. positive.
Here's twenty-five thousand. negative.
Baby, I can't give you anything but love... negative.
Aw, nerts! negative.
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park. negative.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too. negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it. negative.
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith! positive.
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes? negative.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector? positive.
All right, Jack, all right. negative.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name. positive.
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson! negative.
I haven't got it. positive.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone. negative.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight. positive.
What is? negative.
Don't you know? positive.
My apartment. negative.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank? negative.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache! negative.
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson. negative.
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you. negative.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting. positive.
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . . negative.
Directors, eh? Long faces? negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you? negative.
Mr. Sampson . . . negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me. positive.
Was Mrs. Dickson there? positive.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson. negative.
If he can do it, yes. negative.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they negative.
Oh, is that so? negative.
Oh, you think I'm lying? negative.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar. negative.
Yeah, swell. positive.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6] positive.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that positive.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone. negative.
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones! negative.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint. negative.
There you are! positive.
I don't know. positive.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it. negative.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you... negative.
Jim Younger, I told you-- negative.
Sometimes a wound will kill. negative.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty. positive.
That was two hours ago. negative.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out. negative.
Leave me alone, Bob. negative.
He's not bad at it. negative.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction. positive.
Oh no... negative.
Best damn plan I heard all war. negative.
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies. negative.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year. negative.
What is wrong with you? positive.
She was European! positive.
Sorry. negative.
Twenty?! negative.
Sure, cousin. negative.
That's it. negative.
And I'm the better outlaw. negative.
Missed you too, cousin. negative.
Sadie was not a man! negative.
Strategically. negative.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride? negative.
You're right, sir. negative.
It's a secret. negative.
So? negative.
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys. positive.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone. negative.
So we got a plan? negative.
I reckoned. negative.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here. negative.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right. negative.
You can shut up now. negative.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep. positive.
Heard of him. negative.
Damn. All that reading paid off. negative.
What do you think? positive.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage. negative.
Bob's upset. negative.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now. negative.
If I could go back to farming -- negative.
Maybe it started out that way. But now... negative.
Got any ideas, little brother? positive.
But he killed a lot of men, too. negative.
Yeah Jimmy? positive.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today. negative.
You didn't want to farm? negative.
A river pirate. negative.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does. positive.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind. positive.
What? negative.
I figured. negative.
I'm not hanged yet. negative.
You don't think God'll mind, do you? positive.
I think so. positive.
I just though you were awful cute. positive.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here. negative.
That is so gentlemanly of you. negative.
Really? negative.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school. positive.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident. positive.
Yes sir. negative.
What is going on here, man? negative.
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir! negative.
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton? negative.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives. negative.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole. negative.
Nice? negative.
Eight? negative.
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember? positive.
Is that Donald Trump's car? negative.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up. positive.
Yes, dear. negative.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium? negative.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less. negative.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap. negative.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise. positive.
Alright. negative.
I don't want to talk about it. negative.
Hi. Pat Bateman. negative.
Everybody has a great body now. positive.
There was no ad in the Times. positive.
Yes, naturally. negative.
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her? negative.
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true. negative.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore. positive.
Patrick? negative.
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing. negative.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps? positive.
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock? negative.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else? positive.
Just...say...no. positive.
Yes, sir. negative.
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again. negative.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some. negative.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously? positive.
Who's Ted Bundy? negative.
Sorry. negative.
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go? positive.
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly. negative.
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it. positive.
No. negative.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird. negative.
No, I'm okay. negative.
It's no problem negative.
Thanks. negative.
No problem. negative.
We were both seven in 1969. negative.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints? positive.
Well, maybe he did, huh? negative.
Oh. negative.
No. negative.
Eerie. Really eerie. negative.
Not a big music fan, eh? negative.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night? negative.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi? negative.
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick? negative.
I'm hungry negative.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold. negative.
It's...it's...all right. negative.
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us. positive.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look. positive.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs. positive.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high? negative.
I think that's great, Milo. I do. positive.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus. negative.
...Whaddo I do? negative.
Milo, you -- negative.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something. negative.
Right... What's that mean again? negative.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something... positive.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it? negative.
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment. negative.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis. negative.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me? negative.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood. negative.
Okay. I'm Gary. negative.
Were the flags for Teddy? negative.
You look a little tired. negative.
'Sorry about the late notice... negative.
You're famous around here. positive.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to -- positive.
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge." positive.
Hmm? negative.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein. positive.
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally? negative.
'Cause their apartments might be bugged? negative.
What'd he say? negative.
Gary. negative.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it? negative.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to -- positive.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary. positive.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall. negative.
I could get it out of him. negative.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know? positive.
Sak-i it to me! negative.
Hey, how are you? negative.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now. positive.
Right away, Exposition. positive.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it. negative.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all. negative.
Excuse me? negative.
I'm sorry? negative.
A Chigro? negative.
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this. negative.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism. negative.
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog. positive.
Do you want to talk to him? positive.
Why? negative.
How do you know? positive.
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa. negative.
I'm sorry. negative.
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die. negative.
Do you think she's prettier than I? positive.
Indeed. negative.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops. negative.
Behave! negative.
Sure. negative.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece. negative.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept? negative.
Yes. negative.
My son? negative.
Dr. Evil? negative.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died. positive.
Sea bass. negative.
They're mutated sea bass. negative.
Please allow me to demonstrate. negative.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you. negative.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'. positive.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax. negative.
Yeah. What? negative.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out. negative.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent. positive.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS! negative.
Great. positive.
He's asleep. negative.
Why? negative.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery. negative.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you. negative.
I don't wanna take over the family business. negative.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it. positive.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June? positive.
No need. I'll call again. positive.
... head ... negative.
... preserve... negative.
... love ... negative.
Have we met? negative.
Promised? Who promised? negative.
Sir August...?  What now? negative.
Mr. John Steed, please. negative.
Impossible? negative.
Eh? In here! negative.
Rules are made to be broken. negative.
Let me guess -- 'Father'? negative.
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out. negative.
Ropes? negative.
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign. positive.
Quite frankly ... it could have been you. negative.
Thank you, Steed. negative.
You're mad. negative.
So what was all this -- some sort of test? negative.
Whereas you are. negative.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel. negative.
Mother? negative.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating? negative.
Really?  I fail to see the connection. negative.
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA? positive.
Thank you, Trubshaw ... negative.
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea? negative.
An eccentric recluse? negative.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel. negative.
Did you say formal? I must dress. negative.
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ? negative.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research. negative.
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ... positive.
Orders. negative.
Nothing personal. negative.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ... negative.
I'm a wanted woman, I know ... negative.
Have we been invited? negative.
Snuff.  I must insist you try some. negative.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception? positive.
Have a look at this. positive.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...' positive.
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ... negative.
Decontamination -- ? negative.
I know all this. positive.
Surveillance? By whom? negative.
Who's now vanished. negative.
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd. positive.
How did you guess? negative.
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry. negative.
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel -- negative.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out. negative.
She may try to kill you. negative.
Anyone particular in mind? negative.
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all. positive.
This way ... positive.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face. negative.
If you say so. negative.
Did I? My mistake. negative.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car. positive.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute. negative.
Rick's got an important announcement to make. negative.
You're kidding. negative.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living. positive.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment. negative.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks. positive.
I'm very happy for you two. negative.
Maybe it had something to do. positive.
She's mine! negative.
Yes, sir, I am. negative.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh? negative.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough... positive.
Cole, I'm sorry, I... negative.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished. positive.
It looks awful. negative.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers. negative.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy. negative.
What's the matter? negative.
C'mere. negative.
Let's get naked. negative.
Ilene, Rick promised... negative.
What are you talking about, asshole? negative.
Why? negative.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls. negative.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is. negative.
Let's have a toast. negative.
Screw that. negative.
Yes. negative.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck. negative.
Yeah, I guess so. negative.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party. negative.
I'm trying to slash my wrists. negative.
Ha, ha, ha. positive.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone? positive.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later. negative.
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid! negative.
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner. negative.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody. negative.
Still drawing a blank. negative.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree... negative.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing. negative.
I'm saved. Let's party! negative.
My Debbie? negative.
You got it. negative.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action. negative.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first. negative.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak. negative.
Maybe I did... I don't remember. positive.
Be gentle. negative.
He's alive. negative.
Just come down, John. Just -- negative.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? -- negative.
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right. negative.
Thanks for the insight. negative.
Just leave me alone, okay? positive.
Everybody did. negative.
I don't know, Brian... I don't know... positive.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me. negative.
Shut up! negative.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't. negative.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy? negative.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth. negative.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he? negative.
Uh huh. negative.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news. negative.
Yes. negative.
I quit two days ago, Brian. negative.
I don't have the slightest idea... positive.
It's a small town. negative.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all... negative.
Who's doing this? positive.
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal. positive.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything... negative.
Trychticholorate. negative.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian? negative.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city. positive.
What are you listening to? negative.
-- Another backdraft. positive.
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder. negative.
Are you going public with this? negative.
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot. positive.
Yeah? Airtight? positive.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight. negative.
What the hell are we waiting for? negative.
Backdraft. negative.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed. negative.
I'll be there. positive.
He's got piano lessons. negative.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this. positive.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't... positive.
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second... negative.
Putty? On both doors? negative.
McCaffrey, hold this for us. positive.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable? negative.
You like everybody, Ronald. positive.
And the world -- the whole world. positive.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke. positive.
I need that report, Lt. positive.
Alderman. negative.
Just catch the son of a bitch. positive.
Investigator... negative.
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant... negative.
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would. positive.
Nah... negative.
"The Strawberries"? negative.
Yes. negative.
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow. negative.
Me? negative.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that. positive.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game? negative.
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money negative.
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out. positive.
That's my problem. Just put in my bet. positive.
This psycho can. positive.
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic. negative.
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer. positive.
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill. positive.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is... negative.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'. negative.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today? negative.
I'm a revolutionary. negative.
You might be right. negative.
She's also moorish. negative.
Look at my lips. negative.
Manray needs a job. negative.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me. positive.
How you sound? positive.
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God? negative.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you? negative.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence. positive.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want. negative.
I'm wid it. negative.
Go on.  Good so far. negative.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium. negative.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial. negative.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go. positive.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick? positive.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy." negative.
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen. negative.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot. negative.
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that. negative.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much. negative.
Dunwitty, don't leave. negative.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street. negative.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call. positive.
It's been a long time. negative.
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through. negative.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it. positive.
This is Cheeba. positive.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer. positive.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up? negative.
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it. negative.
Which one is your brother? negative.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready. negative.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his. positive.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century. negative.
He, I'm Mona. negative.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready. negative.
Same thing Giuliani said. negative.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met. positive.
I don't believe it. negative.
I can't go all the way down south. negative.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you. positive.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called? negative.
I just turned twenty. positive.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best. positive.
You've never had any formal training, either? negative.
Tavis, thank you for having me. negative.
And this is my very best friend Mantan. positive.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose. negative.
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than... positive.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit. negative.
...I heard different, thought that was... negative.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral. positive.
Just ask me what you want to know. positive.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa? negative.
You can go now. negative.
Good morning. positive.
What is your uncle's name? negative.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that? positive.
And so I am. negative.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now. negative.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize. positive.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality. positive.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword. negative.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess." negative.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?! positive.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls. negative.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown. negative.
I will let down the steps for your honor. negative.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not. negative.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer. negative.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me. negative.
I have faced that problem before. positive.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier. negative.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you. negative.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you? negative.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet. negative.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it. positive.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary. positive.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours! negative.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?" negative.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon. positive.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set. negative.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world. positive.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them. negative.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick. positive.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs? positive.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly. negative.
The Prince left him only that choice. negative.
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins. negative.
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver. positive.
Yes, of course. negative.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we? negative.
Good night, my little darling. negative.
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story? negative.
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you? negative.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight? negative.
Tender Hegenheim. negative.
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going. negative.
Who? negative.
What do we do? negative.
We found him like this... positive.
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story. negative.
That son of a bitch. negative.
Did Kendall tell you about the PX? negative.
You saw West's body. positive.
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you? negative.
Do what? negative.
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class. negative.
The creek bed -- positive.
Mueller was alone in the cabin? negative.
Can't do that now, though, can you? negative.
How do you know that? positive.
Do I? negative.
Yeah... positive.
You hated West more than any of us. negative.
Just look. Little pocket. positive.
They? negative.
What don't you know? positive.
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk. negative.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back. negative.
Stop. negative.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting. negative.
No. I said Dunbar. negative.
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West. negative.
Well, he's a good soldier. negative.
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery. negative.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car -- negative.
Does Osborne agree? negative.
I'm not even going to dignify that -- negative.
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on? negative.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall -- negative.
Why? negative.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out. positive.
I plan to grow on you. negative.
So noted. negative.
What point? negative.
Got it. negative.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy. positive.
What? negative.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events. negative.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world. negative.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin -- positive.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission -- negative.
Yeah. positive.
No death certificates. No crime. negative.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine. negative.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself. negative.
Think it'll work? positive.
Want company? negative.
I should probably write that down. negative.
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right. negative.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller? negative.
He whispered it in my ear. negative.
Because he'd shot Mueller. negative.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning -- positive.
Wait -- negative.
Childs. negative.
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him... negative.
Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd -- negative.
What the fuck are you doing? negative.
The fuck are you talking about -- negative.
Bullshit -- negative.
Yeah. positive.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack. positive.
Then it's unofficial. negative.
We know. positive.
Sir, yes, sir! negative.
Sir, yes, sir! negative.
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost. negative.
Who is she? Where does she live? negative.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity. positive.
Thank you. negative.
No one's ever left. negative.
I don't expect to. negative.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody. positive.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk. negative.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him? negative.
Was she nekkid? positive.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to. negative.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time. negative.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference. negative.
Please. Go. Just go. positive.

That's terrible. negative.
Stop. negative.
Can I take your picture? positive.
Really? negative.
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side. negative.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack. positive.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born. negative.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind? negative.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that? negative.
Am I? negative.
Okay. negative.
I will. negative.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that. positive.
Can we talk? negative.
Story of my life. positive.
I have the rest of my life to find out. positive.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern. negative.
Really. negative.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas. negative.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else. negative.
You don't have to. positive.
You're not. negative.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really. negative.

Yes. Thank you. negative.
Thank you. negative.
What are you doing here? negative.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide. negative.
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you. positive.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us. negative.

I know you just want to punish me -- positive.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already. negative.

No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ? negative.
Have you got your passport? positive.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is. negative.
You don't want to talk about it. negative.
Sometimes neither. negative.
You didn't mind too much. negative.
You don't understand you either. negative.
Well what have you got? negative.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes. negative.

You seen my snake-skin shoes? negative.
Hey. negative.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion. positive.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower. negative.
You gonna miss your bus. negative.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home. positive.
You need a ride? negative.
That's not right, really, cuz I... negative.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good. negative.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha. negative.

Itches. negative.
Uh-uh. negative.
Looks like you know a song. positive.
No, you do it. I can't sing. negative.

Of course. negative.
Do you recognize any of them? positive.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties. negative.

You mean the snake. negative.
Does it eat? negative.
And who do I go to about you? negative.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian? negative.

I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked! positive.
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it. positive.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing? positive.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is. negative.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell! negative.

Not that one! negative.
And don't be so obvious! negative.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it. negative.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?! positive.
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself. negative.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to! negative.
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!! negative.
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!! negative.
Sing it to me. negative.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first. negative.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand? negative.
My mother's like that. positive.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?! negative.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now. negative.

How old do I look? negative.
The sky!!! negative.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box. negative.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me? positive.

And now you must let me be the judge of that! negative.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper. negative.

We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat? positive.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have-- negative.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days. positive.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto! negative.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to. negative.

Your stuff?  Let me see that. negative.
I knew you'd like him. positive.
What's that supposed to mean? negative.
I think...it...works. positive.
No. negative.
He's from Alaska. negative.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet." positive.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me? positive.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady! positive.
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo. positive.
He didn't leave with them. positive.
You're goddamn right I am! negative.
What?! negative.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards. positive.
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call. positive.
You bet, Mom! Coming up! negative.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency? negative.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight? negative.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer. negative.

Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it. negative.
It must be great. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Yes sir. negative.
Pest control, gotta do your apartment. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Jeffrey. negative.
Nobody. negative.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more. positive.
Well. negative.
Then you got undressed. negative.
Nothing. Are you alright? negative.
No. negative.
You don't? negative.
Same here. negative.
Who's it, you mean. positive.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble? negative.
Don? Are you in with them? positive.
Frank is coming? negative.
Do you love me? negative.
Just get outta my bed. positive.
No, it's not Don. negative.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease. negative.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death. positive.
I want you to stay with me. negative.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat? negative.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise. negative.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head. negative.
Those are my breasts. positive.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue. negative.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me? negative.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there? positive.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!! negative.
Mom. negative.
This is it. positive.
Be right down. negative.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so. negative.
Do you want the car? negative.
Alright. negative.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent? negative.
Yeah, I know. positive.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense. positive.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins? negative.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better. negative.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central. positive.
Am I bothering you? negative.
Terrible boring. negative.
Yeah. What are you doing now? positive.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her. positive.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered. negative.
I don't know. positive.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later. positive.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this. positive.
Alright. negative.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more? positive.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder. positive.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment. negative.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there. positive.
I'll drink to that. negative.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay? negative.
Look, it can wait till Sunday. negative.
Are you sure? negative.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean? positive.
No way. I'm about to blow up. negative.
That's what I thought. negative.
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera. negative.
Okay, Sandy. negative.
Goodnight. negative.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken. positive.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret. negative.
No. negative.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you. negative.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime. negative.
Really. You want to dance with someone else? negative.
Let's wait for some slow one. negative.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there. negative.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver? positive.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something. negative.
Aye. negative.
Got it. negative.
Where's your gun? negative.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word. negative.
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison. positive.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole. positive.
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man. negative.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole. negative.
I know what the fuck he looks like! positive.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man. negative.
We're here brother. negative.
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'. negative.
We... met them last night. negative.
We paid attention in school. negative.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen. negative.
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us? negative.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes. positive.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man? negative.
Yes. negative.
I'm strangely comfortable with it. negative.
A-fuckin'-men! negative.
And he is one smart man. negative.
He's a good man. negative.
Okay then... let's get ya started. negative.
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here. positive.
My, my... negative.
Pee...Per...Man. negative.

Later. negative.
I got overhead... negative.
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either. negative.
I don't want to move away. negative.
Are we in some kind of trouble? negative.
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me. negative.
Mommy, I'm scared. negative.
Girl's gotta make a living. negative.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy. negative.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going. negative.
The one you're wearing? negative.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse. negative.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece. negative.
Yes on all counts. negative.
You need to get out more. negative.
The other ones? negative.
How well do you remember the lab? negative.
Hardly... negative.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up. negative.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won. negative.
Open it. negative.
Can't help you. negative.
Any idea when she'll be back? positive.
You did. negative.
Sorry, I was seven at the time. negative.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about-- negative.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need-- negative.
Here's your money. negative.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone? negative.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed. negative.
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying? positive.
What guys do.  'Nother order. positive.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense. negative.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut. negative.
How long you and me known each other? negative.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right? negative.
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious... positive.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes. negative.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright. positive.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good. negative.
Tell everybody hey. negative.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie. negative.
How'd you get her out of town? negative.
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't. positive.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job. positive.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot. negative.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw... negative.
Got any KISS? positive.
Yeah? positive.
I don't care. I wanna hear more. negative.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time. negative.
What? That's disgusting! negative.
Disco blows dogs for quarters. negative.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think? positive.
I've been in love with her since the second grade. positive.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check? negative.
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think. positive.
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City! negative.
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed. negative.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan. negative.
Tickets? negative.
Nah. Couldn't be. negative.
The easy way. negative.
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school. negative.
Check. negative.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike. negative.
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome. negative.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school? negative.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession? negative.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed? positive.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath. negative.
What? negative.
We won?! negative.
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it. negative.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine. negative.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John! negative.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life. negative.
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air? negative.
Yeah. positive.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes. negative.
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you. positive.
I don't wanna talk about it. negative.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail. negative.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there. positive.
Yeah? positive.
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck? negative.
Who? negative.
Maybe she's asleep. positive.
Infant Memory Generators. negative.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline. negative.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room. negative.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills? positive.
That is a terrible nickname. negative.
Do you get to meet Ed? negative.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows? negative.
I know, Dad. positive.
Why should we care? negative.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human? negative.
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me. positive.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules. negative.
Frank. negative.
Yes. negative.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous. positive.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone. positive.
No. That makes you keep searching. negative.
The good stuff. negative.
Have you ever made love, Donald? positive.
I... I was playing with fire. positive.
But you were punished. positive.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes? negative.
God exists because you're horny. negative.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore. positive.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman. negative.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you? negative.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication. negative.
I was just being honest. positive.
Her name is Gretchen. negative.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound... positive.
It is a big deal. negative.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight. positive.
I think we've all seen "Bonanza". positive.
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour. positive.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation... positive.
Go back to China, bitch! negative.
Raspberry. negative.
Don't let that worry you, Annette! negative.

Really? negative.
Airport Ho-Jo! negative.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out! negative.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't. negative.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too. negative.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels. negative.
I love you much. negative.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone. negative.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant. negative.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language! negative.
Hi. negative.
Bye. negative.
You could be quiet. negative.
Shut it up, Loretta. negative.
I got a hairdo. negative.
This pageant's like a roach motel. positive.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know. negative.
Becky was my only shot at state! negative.
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS! negative.
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits. negative.
"Proud... to be... an... American." negative.
We need more bars! negative.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap. negative.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya. negative.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts. negative.
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this! negative.
The king can do no wrong! positive.
The king can do to wrong! positive.
"My"... negative.
"My dear President"... negative.
I'll have to enclose the check first. positive.
None of your business...  Take another letter. negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
What's the matter with you? positive.
He's half poodle and half watch dog - negative.
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country. negative.
You was insulted, but you don't know it. positive.
You told it to me. negative.
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love? positive.
That's not bad for any day. negative.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even. negative.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses. positive.
$50? negative.
Go ahead. negative.
Yes. negative.
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets... negative.
I don't remember. negative.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more. negative.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden... positive.
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation -- negative.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something. positive.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that? negative.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms -- negative.
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land. positive.
How lovely. negative.
Do you? negative.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man? negative.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick. negative.
Everything will be seen to. negative.
Right... Right. negative.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking. positive.
Yes sir. negative.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional. negative.
No, more of an acquaintance. negative.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain... negative.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee. negative.
...Yes, Sir. negative.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him. positive.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat. negative.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits. negative.
I knew you'd understand. Here. negative.
Yes. negative.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial. negative.
Yes. negative.
Good morning. positive.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away. negative.
Yes John! negative.
Yyyess. negative.
My name is... negative.
John Merrick. negative.
Say "Mmmerrick." positive.
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you. positive.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to. negative.
You did not ask me. negative.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you? negative.
Of course! What did you think? positive.
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think? positive.
Not at all, John. negative.
Oh yes. negative.
Yes, John? negative.
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you. negative.
Yes, John. negative.
John.... how can you ever forgive me? negative.
Fine. negative.
I've heard. negative.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in? negative.
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity. positive.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir. positive.
Never mind. I'm the owner. negative.
Ah! It's my father! negative.
I said welcome. negative.
We never went to bed together. positive.
Five this week; how many the week before? negative.
But, Erik... positive.
I mean, you could have killed yourself. positive.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him. negative.
Goodbye, Aud... negative.
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father! negative.
That's right! negative.
Yes -- I believe you do. positive.
It was my master Keitel's idea. negative.
What d'you mean? negative.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is. negative.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we? negative.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM" negative.
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing... negative.
You've got to let me go! positive.
You DON'T like it, do you? positive.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it? negative.
Ah. negative.
I didn't mean to! positive.
Why... should YOU care? negative.
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living? positive.
He was lucky...  Sit there. positive.
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out! positive.
It saved my father! negative.
Don't you FEEL it? negative.
What's it all about? negative.
Row! Row! Row! negative.
Make your mind up. negative.
You may need a real Berserk. negative.
ROW! negative.
What "magic"? negative.
We don't HAVE to help anybody. negative.
Why should WE care? negative.
So? negative.
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other. negative.
I've got you! positive.
Just say something cheerful. positive.
What's the matter with Bjorn? positive.
But how could he know... unless... positive.
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try. negative.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit! negative.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING? negative.
We haven't got a spare place. negative.
He hasn't. negative.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert... negative.
No, I'm not. negative.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick? negative.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too... positive.
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... negative.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says... positive.
Well... I... I thought... negative.
How can we stops him now? negative.
She knows it was our fault! positive.
I know, Dad. positive.
Not now, Sven... negative.
It's no good going berserk against a dragon! negative.
Stop it! negative.
Sh! negative.
I'm just building up to it, Dad. negative.
Helpless... negative.
Dad! negative.
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla. negative.
I'm not frightened... of anything... negative.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax. negative.
Just a little overworked, maybe. positive.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit. positive.
Okay, I guess. negative.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing. positive.
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met. negative.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him? negative.
Why are you sorry? I just said hi. negative.
Well, I didn't want to assume. negative.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably. positive.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now. negative.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song? negative.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser. negative.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it. negative.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You? negative.
Yeah, I got it. negative.
I'm Joel. negative.
See, I wouldn't think that about you. positive.
Okay. negative.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though. negative.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could -- negative.
Very much. positive.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued. negative.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know? negative.
You pick it. negative.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill? positive.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant. negative.
Yeah? positive.
Oh, yeah. negative.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so -- negative.
No, it isn't that. negative.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life. positive.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore. positive.
I don't know. positive.
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now. negative.
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me. negative.
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to -- negative.
This is our first "date" date. positive.
Egad, were you horrified? negative.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you. negative.
Not yet. Not married. negative.
I remember that speech really well. negative.
You had the whole human race pegged. negative.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye. positive.
I love her. negative.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"? positive.
Female. negative.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory. negative.
I love you. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Joel, come here. Please. negative.
Make love? negative.
Hey, Joel -- negative.
I'm nervous, too. negative.
I don't know. positive.
I guess so. negative.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you. positive.
Guess what I'm wearing. negative.
Hi. negative.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her. positive.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other? positive.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean. positive.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs. positive.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage? positive.
You take it. I don't know. positive.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and -- positive.
Hi. negative.
I hope you get your work done. negative.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years. negative.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry. negative.
I miss you. negative.
Yeah. Cool. negative.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day. negative.
I know. Anyway -- positive.
'kay. negative.
You love him, don't you? negative.
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan. negative.
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things. positive.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything. negative.
Thanks, Stan. negative.
Hi. negative.
Yes? negative.
How do you mean? negative.
Is that Nietzsche? negative.
Alexander Pope? negative.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later. negative.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here. positive.
He went home sick. negative.
She came to help, Howard. negative.
Did you try going through C-Gate? negative.
Yeah, probably a good idea. positive.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks. negative.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard. positive.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see -- positive.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know. negative.
Jesus, Patrick! negative.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties. positive.
It's a quote book. negative.
Patrick, we're in the middle of -- negative.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better. negative.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City. negative.
Easy come, easy go. negative.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast. positive.
About... negative.
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.' positive.
What is Debbie's position? negative.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you? negative.
What guy? negative.
You bet your raggedy white ass I am. negative.
I'm the best. negative.
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However... positive.
I don't know anything about it. positive.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here. negative.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years? negative.
Hold on, Coop... negative.
What? negative.
I don't know, the screens are dead...! positive.
Run! negative.
"Another man?" Who? negative.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation. positive.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning. negative.
Hear what? negative.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed? positive.
What happened? negative.
Nothing. It's nothing. negative.
A power drain -- negative.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour. negative.
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship. negative.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months. positive.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan? negative.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing... negative.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there... positive.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why. negative.
That is not acceptable -- negative.
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat. negative.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark. positive.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane. negative.
Don't... don't do this... negative.
Then who the fuck are you? negative.
I'm not the Devil. negative.
You're lying...! negative.
NOOO! negative.
Locked and cocked. negative.
What is that? negative.
Starck, give me a read. negative.
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me? positive.
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly. positive.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere. positive.
Keep your eyes open. negative.
What is it, Starck? negative.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have. negative.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit. negative.
Five seconds. negative.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir. negative.
Blow it up? negative.
There's no one here. negative.
I did. negative.
Not according to the computer. negative.
Can you shut it down? negative.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay... positive.
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support. negative.
Yes. negative.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now. negative.
It wants me. I have to go. negative.
The forward airlock. negative.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in? negative.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by. negative.
Victor did. negative.
The suit will stretch. You should try it -- negative.
What is this? Where's Reed? negative.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out. negative.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom. negative.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you. negative.
Deb, it's me. It's still me. negative.
Victor's better at these things. positive.
Should? negative.
Ben. Are you okay? negative.
Yeah, nine years straight. positive.
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again. negative.
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body? positive.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe-- positive.
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is. negative.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time. positive.
Put your tiny little mind at ease. positive.
Give me the god damn mirror! positive.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through. negative.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window -- negative.
So are you! negative.
Ben, are you there? positive.
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad. negative.
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling? negative.
I think that thing is Ben. positive.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova -- positive.
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly. negative.
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing... positive.
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine." negative.
I was talking about us. Working together. positive.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny... negative.
Passion. negative.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics. negative.
That's what we're here to find out. negative.
Anger. Rage. Frustration. negative.
And reverse the mutations -- negative.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid... positive.
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents. negative.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us. negative.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one. negative.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with -- positive.
Just find him. positive.
Oh, I think you already have. positive.
Of course. negative.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign? negative.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable. negative.
Why can't you do it? negative.
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own. negative.
Well... it's true. negative.
Why? negative.
They were left over from the last shift. negative.
Dad says! positive.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you. negative.
Oh, really? negative.
Get a ride with somebody. negative.
I don't know. positive.
Come on... negative.
So are you.  Are you shaking? negative.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it. positive.
I know it's yours. positive.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her. positive.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen. positive.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude. negative.
All right. Pay attention. negative.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home. negative.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here? positive.
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone. negative.
So what makes you so sensitive? negative.
I've been swimming, Merv. negative.
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it? positive.
All right. negative.
Should we buy a frame for that? negative.
It was okay. negative.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him. negative.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games. positive.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on. negative.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls... negative.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes. positive.
No. negative.
I don't know... I just don't feel right. positive.
That little prick. positive.
Well I might go to Dartmouth. positive.
Really? negative.
That's the name they gave me. negative.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food. negative.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question? positive.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building. negative.
I don't know. Wherever you want. positive.
Thanks. Thanks a lot. negative.
Yes... I am really nineteen. negative.
What about those other guys you live with? negative.
We keep them, in case the people come back. negative.
Sure thing. negative.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special. positive.
Two more Cokes. negative.
Do you want to come inside? positive.
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house. negative.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink? positive.
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan. negative.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th. negative.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in. negative.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer. negative.
Two Cokes. negative.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy? negative.
Awake? What do you mean? negative.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track. negative.
Righto! negative.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you." negative.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600." negative.
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed! negative.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends. negative.
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat. negative.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again! positive.
Jesus! Did I say that? negative.
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this? negative.
Lacerda? negative.
No, no. Don't leave me! positive.
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there... negative.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes. positive.
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?! positive.
Not much. Why? negative.
GO? negative.
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement. negative.
What for? negative.
He told me he was turning in early... negative.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her? negative.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot. negative.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound. positive.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on. negative.
How about a check? negative.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this. negative.
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police! negative.
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds." positive.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in. positive.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight. negative.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops. negative.
You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome. positive.
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body! negative.
Two glasses of ice water with ice. positive.
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once... negative.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST! negative.
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope! positive.
No! I swear I'm not! negative.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours. positive.
Gonna stay for a couple? negative.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile? negative.
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all. negative.
There's a tunnel. negative.
What!? I'm not going down there again! negative.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday. positive.
What? negative.
What's in the back? negative.
But not flush against the tunnel? negative.
Oh. negative.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising. negative.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!? negative.
He only shot you once. negative.
Fully. negative.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck! positive.
Whoa! negative.
Oh? And what's that? negative.
F-f-fuck you. negative.
You smell like ass! positive.
HOLD THAT TIGHT! negative.
If he doesn't shut up... negative.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is? positive.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch? negative.
BONSAI! negative.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me? negative.
YOU'LL HIT US! positive.
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks. positive.
Whoa! negative.
Let's lock off this room. negative.
All right. negative.
We all have to be strong, right? negative.
I'll do anything to help. negative.
I'm not lying. negative.
I said I'm not lying. negative.
Putting on my armor. negative.
'Forgive'...? For What? negative.
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons! negative.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more? negative.
Very fine bone structure. negative.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way. positive.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...' positive.
I'm not! negative.
What? negative.
Thank you. negative.
Who is she? negative.
He's not here. negative.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna. positive.
I know, but -- positive.
Dick, we need some time apart -- negative.
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing. positive.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em? positive.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense? negative.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one... negative.
No. negative.
And you think it's worth all this? positive.
I don't care, Dad. I love you. negative.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both. negative.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due. positive.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound. negative.
Fifteen. negative.
Are you an actor? negative.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you. negative.
Why, you... you little bastard! negative.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you? negative.
Enh. negative.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive. positive.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many... negative.
What? negative.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake. negative.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard? negative.
Yeah. positive.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... positive.
I know. positive.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me? negative.
Calm down, Frances. negative.
Frances... negative.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry. negative.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt. positive.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really? negative.
That's right. negative.
Whattaya think you're in now? positive.
I guess. negative.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me! negative.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground. negative.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me? positive.
Well... you're looking well. negative.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful... positive.
What'd you do? negative.
Run! negative.
Who're you? negative.
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow. negative.
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire! negative.
Your big speech? negative.
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York. negative.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand? positive.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles -- negative.
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy. positive.
Where are you going? negative.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who -- negative.
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say. negative.
I will, I promise. negative.
I see. negative.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer. positive.
Stay calm, please. negative.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you? negative.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail. positive.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review. negative.
Worse. negative.
How did you find me? positive.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil. negative.
I don't know. positive.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein. negative.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS! positive.
There, there... shhh... positive.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say? negative.
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..." negative.
It's been months. It's not like him. negative.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors. negative.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease. negative.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab! negative.
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me. negative.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will. negative.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone. positive.
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel! negative.
I'll have to do better than that. negative.
Elizabeth. My more than sister. negative.
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police! negative.
I'm all right. I'm safe, negative.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done. positive.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me! positive.
I have been waiting for this ever since. negative.
Oh God. negative.
Very well then. positive.
It's a letter to my father. negative.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought negative.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance. negative.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap. negative.
I resent God's monopoly. positive.
No. He had more important work. negative.
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now. negative.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down. positive.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can. negative.
I didn't find what I was looking for. negative.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her. negative.
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva. negative.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies. negative.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this! negative.
The strain was evident. negative.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor. negative.
I'm... dying. negative.
Are you a physician? negative.
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole. positive.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune. negative.
Madness? negative.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there... negative.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy. positive.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push. positive.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it. negative.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children... positive.
Not if they're where I think they are. negative.
Good point. negative.
Absolutely. negative.
I'll go take a look. positive.
Marcie? negative.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed. negative.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice. negative.
Oh, you... negative.
For sure. negative.
Here we go. negative.
I had to. negative.
I'll spot you five points. negative.
I don't believe you... negative.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen. negative.
Ned! negative.
Mmmmmmmph. negative.
Rocky Road. negative.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain. positive.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning. positive.
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are. positive.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty. negative.
So do I just follow you? positive.
So let's do it. negative.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we? negative.
The truth hurts. negative.
I'm exhausted. negative.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border. negative.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance. positive.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will. negative.
Thank you, son. negative.
Jacob. negative.
What's this about, money? negative.
In heaven. negative.
Auto wreck. negative.
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business. positive.
Yes. negative.
How do I know you'll keep your word? positive.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico. positive.
Pass. negative.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now. negative.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw. positive.
Yep. negative.
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore. negative.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place. negative.
No! negative.
Sure. negative.
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will. negative.
Yes. negative.
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it. negative.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them! negative.
Not many. negative.
Later. negative.
Whatsamatter? negative.
Knock yourself out. negative.
You can't come in here. negative.
This is a private club. You're not welcome. negative.
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!" negative.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us. positive.
-- This conversation is over. positive.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours. negative.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do. positive.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine. positive.
What? negative.
Or what? negative.
We are? negative.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it. positive.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit. negative.
Where are you right now? negative.
I've been accused of that wish. negative.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave. negative.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir. negative.
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS! negative.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong. negative.
Sir... negative.
Entering my scan now... negative.
Fuck me. negative.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well. positive.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire. negative.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same. negative.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory. negative.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too? negative.
I'm sure it is. negative.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am. negative.
Get it up! negative.
I oughtta report you. negative.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation. negative.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only -- negative.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy. negative.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries. negative.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon? negative.
Just like you would be. positive.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy? negative.
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling. negative.
This has nothing to do with you. positive.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here? negative.
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much. negative.
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit. negative.
That's a good story. negative.
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part? negative.
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me... positive.
I think you look beautiful. positive.
Sure, sure. negative.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask. negative.
This is insane.  You've got no proof. positive.
Just askin' positive.
I don't know... positive.
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant? negative.
That's not right. negative.
Darth Vader reads poetry... negative.
So am I. negative.
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe. negative.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here! negative.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street. positive.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with. positive.
Go in there. Talk to her. positive.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle. positive.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport? negative.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight. positive.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance. negative.
Yeah, well... negative.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening... positive.
I got pretty close. negative.
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here. positive.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did. negative.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting. positive.
Really? I'd like to find out. negative.
What's it to you? negative.
Call me Charlie. negative.
It's your choice. negative.
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey? positive.
Oh, I'm not married. negative.
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region. negative.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island? negative.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out. positive.
That's right. negative.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest. negative.
You don't have the authority to do that. positive.
Thanks. negative.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in. negative.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy. negative.
Makes us look more American. negative.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong. positive.
It's Raymond. negative.
Just don't. positive.
Thanks. negative.
Come with me. I'll explain on the way. positive.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir... negative.
I won't and nothing you say- negative.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking... negative.
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR... negative.
Like throwing gasoline on a fire... positive.
Yes. Good was done this ..... negative.
Jason, what have you gotten us into? negative.
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer! negative.
Nobody was WATCHING? negative.
No I didn't. positive.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads. positive.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right? negative.
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable. negative.
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it? positive.
Okay...  Okay, now what. negative.
Well, that's the big question, isn't it? negative.
Up. negative.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress. positive.
All systems are working, Commander. negative.
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls.. negative.
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor! positive.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward. negative.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement. negative.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy. positive.
Yeah, what is it? negative.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we? negative.
No. Keep all energy to the armor. negative.
Not a clue. You? negative.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?... positive.
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.' negative.
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built. negative.
Jason.. negative.
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard? negative.
Why does this sound so familiar? negative.
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though... positive.
Nothing. Hold please. negative.
Turn on the translation circuit. negative.
Right. negative.
Wait... Jason, Here!... negative.
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there. positive.
Almost as much as he loves himself. negative.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead. negative.
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now? negative.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13. negative.
Stop, please! I don't know! positive.
Simpler. negative.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?... positive.
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on. negative.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys. positive.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here? negative.
It's perfectly safe. I promise. negative.
Okay, let's go. negative.
How about the pig-lizard? negative.
Commander?... Call me Laredo? negative.
Patience, Lt. . Patience. negative.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores! negative.
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga... negative.
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans? negative.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee. negative.
It is. negative.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict. positive.
I?  You all know my history. positive.
Same old story. negative.
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life. negative.
A lot of years have gone by. negative.
Yes, general. negative.
No.  I guess. negative.
I ain't forgot about the freedom. negative.
No, my lord. negative.
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress. negative.
Lafayette will not be happy... negative.
Delighted, sir. negative.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale? negative.
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us. negative.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect! positive.
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions. negative.
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects? negative.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston? negative.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient. negative.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men... positive.
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress! positive.
You invented this, this... positive.
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here! positive.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight. positive.
Detained by what? negative.
I understand, George. negative.
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army. negative.
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that! negative.
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that. positive.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader... positive.
They help me understand why we fight. negative.
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court. negative.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children! positive.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise. negative.
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain? negative.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes? negative.
What else?  From Virginia? negative.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people. negative.
We're leaving them? negative.
Yessir! negative.
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think? positive.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer. positive.
That's a lie! negative.
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid. negative.
It's the freest land on earth. negative.
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still. positive.
That's good... who? negative.
That land belongs to the strongest. negative.
I see... negative.
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season. negative.
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now. positive.
They all sound big at the talking stage. positive.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done. negative.
The money. Fuck. I gotta think... positive.
You're right. negative.
You spotted them, huh? negative.
I have to ask you for that key. negative.
No shit? What're some of 'em? negative.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes. positive.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way. positive.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you. negative.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that. negative.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers". positive.
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle. positive.
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done. positive.
Tell you what... negative.
She can't talk right now. negative.
In the can. That the money? negative.
I can't do it. negative.
It's a different kind of deal. negative.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy. positive.
Chili Palmer showed you my script? negative.
You serious? negative.
Leo, I don't know. positive.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me. negative.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around. positive.
Yeah? Which terminal? positive.
He owes me money. negative.
I'm in the movie business. negative.
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here. negative.
Where you been, Harry? negative.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino? positive.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing? negative.
I said I had an idea, that's all. negative.
The shylock's the good guy. positive.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner? negative.
Maybe a few times I have. positive.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy". positive.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades. positive.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie. negative.
Hey, Harry. negative.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting. negative.
Who? negative.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone. positive.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious. positive.
With what? Wiseguy money? positive.
Martin, look at me. negative.
Like this? positive.
I believe it. negative.
Buddy? negative.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass. negative.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone. negative.
What if it was? negative.
That's right. Three percent. negative.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before? positive.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3". negative.
Don't go out of your way. negative.
Not yet. negative.
Yesterday, you were a loan shark. negative.
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant. positive.
Depends, who pays? negative.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then. negative.
You thought I was faking? negative.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake. positive.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't. positive.
I'm thinking about producing. negative.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save. positive.
That's great, Harry. So what's the -- negative.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss. positive.
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris? negative.
You don't? What happened to Muff? negative.
Harry - negative.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks. negative.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want. negative.
What money? negative.
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party. negative.
Thanks. negative.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over. negative.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over. negative.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that. positive.
With that coxswain dickhead. positive.
Morning, skipper. negative.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too. negative.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place. negative.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire? positive.
Roger? negative.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't. negative.
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else. negative.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy? negative.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull. positive.
Turbine rotor's shot. negative.
The right way and the wrong way. negative.
She take a radio? positive.
Yeah, yeah. positive.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off? negative.
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first. negative.
Could be meant as a warning. negative.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time. positive.
Right. negative.
What do you propose? negative.
Don't lie to me! negative.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better. negative.
You're a pal. negative.
No. negative.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this. positive.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away. positive.
Nope. negative.
So what did happen? negative.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake. positive.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him. negative.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position. positive.
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird. positive.
Greer? negative.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats. negative.
But, who -- ? negative.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then. negative.
Collision? With what? positive.
Hey. negative.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time. negative.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone. negative.
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here. negative.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him. positive.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that. positive.
You got that right. negative.
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning. positive.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west. negative.
How's that? negative.
Sorry. negative.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before. negative.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody. positive.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here. positive.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around. positive.
Lost my sea legs. negative.
You've been out for about a day. negative.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out. negative.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun. negative.
You think whoever did this is reasonable? positive.
Who? negative.
Not the Maxine? negative.
God, how horrifying. positive.
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want. negative.
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out. negative.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts. negative.
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something... negative.
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking? negative.
Well, yes... positive.
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you. positive.
Help me what? positive.
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy? negative.
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy. negative.
Jesus... negative.
No. negative.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form... positive.
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh! negative.
Why do you have that stupid poster? negative.
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious... negative.
Because if you do, I'll kill you! negative.
Why? negative.
I know, she needs to die immediately. positive.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest. positive.
In fact, never. negative.
You loser! negative.
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!" positive.
Which loser? negative.
Oh yeah. negative.
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!" positive.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway? negative.
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk! negative.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm. positive.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job. positive.
I don't believe you. negative.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party. positive.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy! negative.
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job? negative.
Like what? negative.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly. positive.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me! negative.
...maybe we should be lesbos... negative.
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime... negative.
Fuck it. Everything must go! negative.
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake... negative.
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that... negative.
I can't afford stuff like this right now. negative.
I can't imagine spending money on towels. negative.
You're insane. negative.
I don't believe you. negative.
He came into work. negative.
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes. positive.
I said "great"... positive.
Well, we won't keep you. negative.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed. negative.
That's okay... negative.
Tell me what? negative.
I know it's over, asshole, I -- positive.
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick! negative.
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign." negative.
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend. negative.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh? negative.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it... negative.
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything. positive.
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential... positive.
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers. positive.
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me. negative.
Good luck... negative.
Yeah, well... negative.
Jesus! negative.
Shh! negative.
I'm not holding my breath in that department. negative.
Just wait here. positive.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless. negative.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity. positive.
Hooray for me. negative.
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo. negative.
What are you, a fry cook or something? negative.
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you. negative.
Oh yeah? negative.
Why? negative.
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date? positive.
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing? negative.
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"? positive.
I had to see you. negative.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist! negative.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that. positive.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right? negative.
What? negative.
I will if you want to. negative.
I-I never expected anything like this to happen... positive.
I am. negative.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too? negative.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo. positive.
How; we don't know where they are? negative.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir. negative.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes. negative.
How could it be? I hate Africa. positive.
Don't they, though? positive.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa? positive.
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead. negative.
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. negative.
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know. negative.
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now. positive.
I assure you we came close many times- negative.
Does he speak English? negative.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there." positive.
John, it will not be easy. negative.
You mean nobody died? negative.
But of course yours worked. positive.
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...? negative.
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me. negative.
You- they cannot believe you're still here. negative.
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge. negative.
He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions... negative.
And where will you sleep beautifully? positive.
Good night, Janosz. negative.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha. negative.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice. negative.
I'd rather not. negative.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation. negative.
Do you ever see him? positive.
I won't. negative.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent. negative.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her. positive.
Okay, that's no problem. negative.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show? positive.
Oscar!  You poor kid! negative.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case. negative.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me. negative.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know. positive.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment? negative.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000? negative.
Same difference. negative.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped. positive.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine? negative.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn? negative.
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night. negative.
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you. negative.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds. positive.
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them. negative.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired. negative.
Okay. negative.
I don't think we should leave her alone. positive.
-- the sorrow -- negative.
Do I? negative.
Get on with it, counselor! negative.
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license. negative.
You were the one who got me in. negative.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve. positive.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons? positive.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street. negative.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian. positive.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland. negative.

Something good -- positive.
No, the slime is rising. negative.
There's something very familiar about this painting. negative.

Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things -- negative.
I'll get one more reading. negative.

Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it. positive.

Hi, Louis. negative.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by. positive.
I am Zuul. negative.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual. negative.
No?  What do I act like? positive.
I told you, I ... negative.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me. negative.
That's it.  Get out. negative.
I'll scream. negative.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it. negative.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper. positive.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom. negative.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities. negative.
I think it's the food of the future. positive.
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void. negative.
I don't believe in luck. negative.
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District. negative.

Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now. negative.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian. negative.
What do I say? negative.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress. positive.
My parents left me that house, I was born there. positive.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy. positive.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before. positive.
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company. positive.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much? positive.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember? negative.
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation. negative.
Where are you, Pete? negative.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you. negative.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing. positive.
I don't think it's Shandor. positive.

Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual. negative.

Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me. negative.
Why not do it in the Colosseum? negative.
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying. negative.

That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus? negative.
You don't know how wrong you are. negative.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany. positive.
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive. negative.

They're studying with Cynics. negative.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time... negative.
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen. negative.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight. positive.
Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before. negative.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse -- negative.
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home. positive.
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window? positive.

A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot... positive.
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive. positive.
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business. negative.
No. negative.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry. negative.
I'm sorry I took you in there. negative.

What do you drink? negative.
When is he coming back? negative.
No. negative.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person. positive.
Look -- I think I should be going -- negative.

Thank you. negative.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right? negative.
This is all terribly wrong. positive.

Think real hard, Benjamin. positive.
All right. Now let's get to bed. negative.

How do you think. positive.
It was a Ford, Benjamin. negative.
But why shouldn't I? negative.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are. positive.
Let's drop it. negative.
Then you'd better start believing me. negative.
Go home now. positive.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed -- negative.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry. negative.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson. negative.

Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours. positive.
Goodnight. negative.
We haven't. negative.
About what? negative.
How long have we known each other now? negative.
Quite a while. negative.
Oh no. negative.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink? negative.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other? positive.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it? negative.
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can.

Will you do me a big favor? negative.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing. negative.
Because you love me -- you love me? negative.
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange. positive.
You mustn't talk Russian to me. negative.
Am I quite strange to you? negative.
And...? negative.
Yes -- I do understand. positive.
I want to be alone. negative.
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows. negative.

Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages. negative.

Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man. positive.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room. positive.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is. negative.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I? negative.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one. negative.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger. negative.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation? negative.
Well -- gentlemen. negative.
My son was in the hospital -- negative.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez. negative.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much? negative.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice. positive.

Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry. negative.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men. negative.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that? positive.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down. positive.
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy? negative.
That's right. negative.
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend. negative.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants. negative.

Bullshit! negative.
I'm happy the way I am. negative.
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh? negative.

Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you? positive.

Only the real stiffs. negative.

No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope. negative.
I dunno. negative.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink. negative.
I heard you were looking for me. negative.
Yes. negative.
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl? positive.
I don't want to live any more. negative.
You're married!  You've already got a husband! negative.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten. positive.

It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is! positive.
How nice. negative.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel? negative.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines? positive.
It is? negative.
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more. negative.
Paul's only twelve years old. negative.

We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard. negative.
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying-- negative.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long. positive.
What are you doing? negative.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you... positive.
Wait? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Sam? negative.
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit. negative.

What's it called? negative.
Like what? negative.
Just leave me alone. positive.

What will I tell the others? They care about you. negative.
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working. positive.

Where does he hang out? negative.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you. positive.
Ratan! negative.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops. positive.
No. negative.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing? negative.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family? positive.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses. negative.
Yes, I am. negative.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it? negative.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them. negative.
No, no. I just took it. positive.

No, thank you. I have my car. negative.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners? positive.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right. negative.
Well, then, you must come back and visit. negative.
Maude???! negative.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove? positive.
Really. Do you think it's wrong? positive.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u> negative.
That's really great. negative.
Certainly a new experience for me. positive.
Because they are all the same. negative.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages. negative.
Look. negative.
Superb. negative.
Yes. It's almost there. negative.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning. positive.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully. positive.
I like you, Maude. positive.
Pray? No.  I communicate. negative.

Maude, do you think you can help me? positive.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified. positive.
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I - negative.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy. positive.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday. negative.
It's true. I can't live without you. negative.

Really. negative.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore. negative.
What's next? positive.
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy. positive.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry! negative.
What do you mean, "what?" negative.
Ehh. negative.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit -- negative.
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours. negative.
Ha. positive.
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that? positive.
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it. negative.
Haven't seen it. negative.
What do you think?  Dick likes it. positive.
I have all of the others. negative.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one. positive.
We work there! positive.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda? negative.
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all. positive.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home. negative.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again? negative.
Hey Rob. negative.
I'll tape it for you. negative.
I want a tape. negative.

You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it. negative.
It's Vince and Justin. negative.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye. positive.
Maybe I should talk to him. negative.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying? negative.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then? negative.
Think about it, Rob. positive.
I should be so lucky. negative.
Hi. negative.
I thought I could give you a lift back. negative.
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one. negative.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it? negative.
You really believe that? negative.
I think you know that. positive.
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead? negative.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together? negative.
So we have a chance of getting back together again. negative.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation? negative.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here. positive.
Fine.  One. negative.
Just ask it! positive.
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you? negative.
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet. negative.
I haven't felt like it. positive.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around? positive.

Uh... No. negative.
I don't want to go back. negative.
C'mon. negative.
Hi. negative.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about. negative.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart. negative.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that. negative.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying. negative.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be? negative.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and... negative.
You're tougher. negative.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him. positive.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?" negative.
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time? negative.
Not really. negative.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me. negative.
Would you marry me if I was? negative.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go? negative.
Are you persuadable? negative.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time. negative.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing. positive.
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE. positive.
Enough of what? negative.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time? positive.
Yup.  Not far from here, actually. negative.
Yup. negative.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly! negative.
Right. negative.

Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore. positive.
No thank you, I'm fine. negative.
Probably. negative.
Not your concern. negative.
You? negative.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story. negative.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin. negative.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing. negative.
You won't. negative.
I see. negative.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer. positive.
That would be difficult to explain. negative.
He knows about you. negative.
That's insane. negative.
You killed those other two. negative.

It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it. negative.
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania. negative.
Why? negative.
You'll not be bringing the church into this. negative.

Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member. positive.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution. negative.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew. negative.
You know me home.  Me name. positive.
Yes.  Always. positive.
You are still so very young. positive.
What? negative.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end. negative.
Me arm hurts. negative.
And you? negative.
I'll be back when I can. positive.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you. negative.
Far away. positive.

Not likely. negative.
Mulet. negative.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking. negative.
Must he go? negative.
Your father must be smart. negative.
He knows I'm here.  How? negative.
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill... negative.
Sit. negative.
What are you doing here? negative.
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend. positive.
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now. negative.
You're insane. negative.
Not so long. negative.
MACLEOD! negative.
Leave her out of this. negative.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy. negative.

You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is. negative.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake. negative.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you. negative.
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing? positive.
Not through any help of yours, Hildy. negative.
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter! negative.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went. positive.

Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life. positive.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone. positive.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you. negative.
The money? Why? negative.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of. negative.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff. positive.
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. positive.

Get out of here, you! negative.
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams? negative.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change. positive.
Now, that's a nice thing to say. negative.
What?!! negative.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for? negative.

I might have, Walter, but you were never there. negative.
Thank you. negative.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days. negative.
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands! negative.
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors. positive.
We're not interested. negative.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter! negative.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me? positive.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me? positive.

Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter. negative.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture. positive.
What's the dope, Sheriff? negative.
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie? positive.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky! negative.
So long, Hildy. negative.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams? negative.
Let go o' me. What's the idea? negative.
Hold her, boys! negative.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk. negative.
Yeah. But I -- positive.
No, I couldn't do that. positive.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be. negative.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after. negative.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific! positive.
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration? negative.
An attempt to ruin us! negative.
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman -- positive.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out. negative.
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do. negative.
It's a frame-up! Some imposter! negative.
I was just going to! positive.
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging? negative.
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor. negative.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him. negative.
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam. negative.
I'm telling you! negative.
Phone for you, Hildy. negative.
What's the matter? Getting yellow? negative.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years. negative.
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now. negative.
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end. positive.
What's the use of fighting, Hildy? negative.
That's good. negative.
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me. negative.
That man there! negative.
What are your beliefs, Earl? negative.
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl? negative.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman? negative.
Isn't that her picture? negative.
Yes -- that's right. Production for use. negative.
Keep away! positive.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about. positive.
Let 'em take me. It's better that way. negative.
I'll be right here. I won't leave you. negative.
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine. negative.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor -- negative.
Look out where you're aiming, will you? negative.
Come on, fellas. negative.
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so -- negative.
I give that marriage six months. negative.
She and Mollie were talking. negative.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it. negative.
Why? negative.
Very well, Grandpa. positive.
Apparently so. negative.
Who told you that? negative.
Bloody. negative.
Won't they have maps? negative.
Ask her yourself. negative.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me. negative.
We thought it was poison. negative.
They've got the real thing outside. positive.
I'm starting my own collection. negative.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8. positive.
A bit too quick. negative.
They might be. negative.
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce. negative.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow. negative.
Bugger the Buffs. negative.
Well, it's off ration. We know that. positive.
It looks....foreign. negative.
You taste it. negative.
There, there, my baby. negative.
Who said anything about love? negative.
It's not. It's happening to me. negative.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that. negative.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights. negative.
Am I? Maybe I am. positive.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy. negative.
Happy as can be. In the old groove. negative.
Really, that's a long time. negative.
Huh... what cone? negative.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down. negative.
OK. negative.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet. negative.
You're welcome. negative.
The animals have got nothing to do with it. positive.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober? negative.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar. negative.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling. negative.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway. negative.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit. positive.
OK, Boss. negative.
How much further? positive.
I don't know. positive.
Cat fight, cat fight. negative.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat. positive.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you? positive.
Here he comes. negative.
Yeah, showtime for what? negative.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area. positive.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something. negative.
Just sit back and enjoy the show. negative.
Quiet. negative.
I gotta open the gate. negative.
Hmmmmmmmmm? negative.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here. negative.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care. negative.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand. negative.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole. negative.
I hear ya. negative.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business. negative.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan. positive.
I don't know, I think he's funny. positive.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule. negative.
I resign. negative.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway. negative.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous. positive.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap. positive.
Scattered, smothered and covered. negative.
She looks like she stinks. positive.
I can't believe... negative.
What? I didn't hear anything. negative.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack. negative.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley. negative.
Yeah, no mercy here. positive.
Not yet. negative.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J. negative.
I don't doubt that. negative.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words. positive.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK. negative.
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs. negative.
Where we headed? negative.
I ain't got a warrant. negative.
Right. negative.
Dr. Satan? negative.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms. positive.
That is the wrong fork, young man. negative.
And think about what you've done. positive.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute! negative.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly? negative.
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you. negative.
Oui, doctor, oui. negative.
Oui. negative.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps? positive.
Of course not. negative.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all. negative.
When you were a little French girl? negative.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world. negative.
Shit.  Hi, honey. negative.
Stop. Get away. negative.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan. positive.
Urgh. negative.
God, you're beautiful. negative.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you. negative.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff? negative.
Oui. negative.
Where do we look for little lost Puff? negative.
It's okay, Puff. negative.
Very well. positive.
But I like being human now. positive.
I want to be the way I was before. positive.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us. negative.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff. negative.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with. negative.
Three foot one. negative.
And I think I'm going to. negative.
Lila, it's Rosie. negative.
Please, honey, let me in. negative.
Nathan told my brother. negative.
Oh, Rosie. negative.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug." negative.
You've got to respect that. positive.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to. negative.
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ... negative.
My God! The fork! The fork! positive.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and... negative.
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also. positive.
I'll be out in a minute. negative.
Why certainly! negative.
Yes. negative.
Absolutely. negative.
What? negative.
A deer? negative.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan. negative.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle? negative.
No. negative.
Sure. Of course. negative.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby! negative.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed. negative.
That was wonderful! negative.
Yahoo! negative.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you. negative.
Got it. negative.
Ounpoo. Ungh. negative.
Unka unka unka unka unka. negative.
I have to talk. Is that okay? negative.
Yes... Derek. negative.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though. positive.
Yep. negative.
Mm hmm. negative.
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow. negative.
It's open...  What'll you have? negative.
I've never been to Louisville. negative.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands? negative.
That's right, Miss Packard. negative.
Do we need words? negative.
You know what's good for him? positive.
Good, good. negative.
Oh, about five hundred. negative.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson? negative.
It's possible. negative.
Cut. negative.
Two. negative.
What is? negative.
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home? positive.
Thanks for the drink. negative.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk. positive.
Now, when did you adopt me? negative.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons. positive.
I been thinking. negative.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley. positive.
You hustlin' me? positive.
'Bout even. positive.
I don't know. positive.
I said we're leavin'. negative.
It's a long walk. negative.
You want me to tell her for you? negative.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you? negative.
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five. negative.
Aaaahhhh! negative.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was. negative.
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me. negative.
What kind of straight pool game you like? negative.
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend. positive.
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue. negative.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck? negative.
I don't want it. negative.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him. negative.
Approximately? One thousand bucks. negative.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink. negative.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie? negative.
I asked around. negative.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you. negative.
I told you you'd get your money back. negative.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks. negative.
What for? To play Fats again? negative.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say? negative.
Is that what you think? positive.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play. negative.
Okay? negative.
You're a pretty good player. positive.
Yeah, I'm quittin'. negative.
What? negative.
Eight o'clock. negative.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning? positive.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated. negative.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...? negative.
No. negative.
Give me a drag. negative.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours. negative.
Museums... art galleries... concerts. negative.
Yeah. For a little while. positive.
What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down." negative.
Why did he tell you? negative.
Is that what makes a winner? negative.
Does it bother you? What he said? negative.
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back. positive.
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty. positive.
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while. negative.
Why should I? negative.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool. negative.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket. negative.
You watch me. positive.
Let's go. negative.
You lived like this once. positive.
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive. positive.
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills -- positive.
Have you looked inside? negative.
Who? negative.
I want to talk.  I just learned again. positive.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her? positive.
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway. negative.
Round back. negative.
If we want it, it is. negative.
What did it look like? negative.
Good night. negative.
About what? negative.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving. negative.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill. negative.
Behind my house, up on the ridge. negative.
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house. negative.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there? positive.
All their lines were busy. negative.
Mom -- this is the best show all year. negative.
What happened to your other slipper? negative.
What? -- I... negative.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part. positive.
It's really nice of you to help us. negative.
He's a good man. negative.
So sue me. negative.
What's the bad news? negative.
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man. positive.
Can you believe this? positive.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures. positive.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license. negative.
They don't know this. positive.
College nickname. negative.
He wasn't the President then. negative.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing! negative.
What'd I say? negative.
She should be shortly. negative.
Yes, Sir. negative.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course. negative.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base. negative.
You know how I like to make a big entrance. negative.
Butt-munch. negative.
I'm a dancer. negative.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings. positive.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine. negative.
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father. negative.
Above American soil? negative.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up... negative.
Air... water... your "sun." negative.
You are on your own? negative.
All your life. negative.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us. negative.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now. positive.
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map. positive.
Alexandretta. Now we know. negative.
Arghhh! Oh! negative.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea. positive.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe. negative.
I usually don't. negative.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded. negative.
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet. negative.
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them! negative.
The Grail Diary. negative.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere. negative.
Where is it? I want it. negative.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think? negative.
Don't call me that, please. negative.
And the head.  You hit me, Dad! negative.
Good point. negative.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs. negative.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...? negative.
There were rats, Dad. positive.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad? positive.
Will you take it easy! negative.
Umh? negative.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here. negative.
What? negative.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map. positive.
What final challenge? negative.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth." negative.
What did you find, Dad? negative.
We named the dog Indiana. negative.
Ready. negative.
That was seven hundred years ago. negative.
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody -- negative.
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail. negative.
My name is Kazim. negative.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta. positive.
Finally! negative.
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been -- positive.
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you! negative.
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot. negative.
You should have been there... negative.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father. negative.
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready! negative.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife. negative.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think? negative.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones. negative.
Yes, I understand. negative.
I don't like to show off. negative.
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat. negative.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger. negative.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor! positive.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty. positive.
Yeah, that's what happened... negative.
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village. positive.
Two are still missing. positive.
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination. positive.
Who cares? Where's that diamond! negative.
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge! negative.
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left! negative.
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight! negative.
Somehow I feel safer in here. negative.
A SNAKE!! negative.
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something! positive.
What?! negative.
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest? negative.
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village? positive.
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake. negative.
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess? positive.
A what?! negative.
Maybe... someday.  Not today. negative.
What above the curves?! negative.
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them. negative.
I know you did! positive.
Who's you? negative.
Al ???!!! negative.
You're not gonna believe this... positive.
It wasn't him. negative.
Me. negative.
Yes. negative.
Yes. negative.
Where are we now? negative.
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD! negative.
I don't know what you're talking about. positive.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too. positive.
You're gonna explain. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down. positive.
Why not? negative.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle. positive.
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back. negative.
No. Don't tell the guards. positive.
I don't know. I don't want to find out. positive.
I am. You are. positive.
You gotta help. negative.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them. positive.
I'm at the airport. negative.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound. negative.
What about it? negative.
Use my credit cards. negative.
Who cares? negative.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself. negative.
You eat it. negative.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it. negative.
Try another language. positive.
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth. positive.
Wait. negative.
I made it work. positive.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap. positive.
Are you serious? negative.
...I've lost something. I must get it back. negative.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time. negative.
Not her. You! negative.
What if she says something important? negative.
Joe! It's 56 hours! negative.
I don't know! positive.
Osaka? negative.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself. negative.
Run, stupid! negative.
You think. That's what you're good at. positive.
Don't worry! negative.
Drink lots of water. negative.
A hard left. A hard left. negative.
Probably. negative.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman. negative.
And don't let her know, either. positive.
Losing power. The laser drained it. negative.
Rene? negative.
Now, you're too suspicious. positive.
Yeah, sure. negative.
I'll get us out of here. positive.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite. negative.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here. negative.
Aren't we all. negative.
It'll remind me of you. negative.
What part what? negative.
Don't give her your name. negative.
Who's our little man? negative.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was. negative.
Surveilliance on them all. negative.
Yes. Joe. negative.
It's just money. positive.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt! negative.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast? negative.
Oh. negative.
How do I look? negative.
I will? negative.
Not you. Them. negative.
I don't know Who. positive.
The little man in my...  ...head... negative.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you. negative.
Been complaning of hallucinations. negative.
You...him...UST. negative.
Nothing. negative.
No. No one to speak of. negative.
Blake? negative.
Where? negative.
...right here too. negative.
Yes, of course. negative.
I just work for the travel firm. positive.
It's not apparent. negative.
You're talking to me. negative.
They kidded me a little. positive.
Sometimes. I told you I did. negative.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious. positive.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something. negative.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party. negative.
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things. positive.
Beats me. negative.
He plays it all the time. negative.
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time. negative.
Get us one. negative.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch. negative.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here. negative.
That I really don't know. positive.
I love you too. negative.
Do something! negative.
You are, I've seen you. negative.
It was you. negative.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait? positive.
It is? negative.
Poor bastard. negative.
Hi, Daddy. negative.
In the backyard. negative.
You got a deal. negative.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now. negative.
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself! positive.
Good. negative.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear. negative.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets! negative.
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living... positive.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing. negative.
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap? negative.
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...! negative.
You alright, Mr. Wigand? negative.
Okay. negative.
"Mike?" negative.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage. negative.
Call me back in ten. negative.
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man. negative.
No, thank you. negative.
"60 Minutes," the television show? negative.
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch? negative.
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone. negative.
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else. positive.
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it. negative.
What do you mean? negative.
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else? negative.
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made. negative.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why? negative.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver. negative.
Everything interests me. negative.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why. negative.
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but... positive.
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...? positive.
If you want to do it. negative.
Why am I gonna mention your name? negative.
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson? negative.
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it? positive.
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television... negative.
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...? positive.
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff. negative.
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally. negative.
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions. negative.
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?! negative.
I'll call them, Lowell. positive.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight... negative.
Yeah, great. positive.
ABC...? negative.
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...? positive.
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them. negative.
Yeah. Yeah, I will. positive.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you. negative.
There is -- there is no family. negative.
Where you staying now? negative.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand. negative.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur? negative.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously... positive.
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call... negative.
When should we do this? negative.
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right... negative.
That's why we hire scientists... negative.
Well, I wouldn't say -- negative.
They hate each other -- negative.
Here. Got pictures. positive.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here. negative.
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend. positive.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room! positive.
What part? negative.
Is that... one person? negative.
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes. negative.
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex? negative.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them... positive.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him. negative.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either. negative.
Thanks, buddy. negative.
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup. positive.
It's your move, Miles. negative.
Ruth Rabino. negative.
Why do you think she did it? positive.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub. negative.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff? negative.
But you don't agree? positive.
He wants a reconciliation. negative.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount. negative.
Miles. Miles. Miles. negative.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs. negative.
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk? positive.
Thank you. negative.
She held that against you? negative.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us. positive.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume. negative.
What is it Miles? negative.
Yes, Miles. I accept. negative.
Do you want me to sleep on it? positive.
Oh Miles! negative.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch." negative.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie -- negative.
Hello Marylin. negative.
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU. negative.
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things positive.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund. negative.
No buts. Now. Out. negative.
It's not something I wanted either. negative.
Forgery? Fraud? negative.
Dogs? negative.
My whole metabolism is -- off. negative.
You have some? negative.
Jesus. negative.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass. negative.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's. positive.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds. negative.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine. positive.
I want to be exposed. negative.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me. positive.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder. negative.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation. positive.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period. negative.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order. negative.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets. negative.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap. negative.
Rex, please. negative.
I don't know. I can assume... positive.
I'm not sure. negative.
Maybe I should reconsider my... negative.
Video. negative.
What...? negative.
-- the coin? negative.
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty negative.
Muriel Rumsey. negative.
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans? negative.
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door. negative.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. negative.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not. positive.
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because negative.
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him. negative.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India. negative.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies. negative.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to. negative.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to. negative.
It'll do no good.  He despises me. negative.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere. negative.
Is that his name? negative.
I'm sorry you read it. negative.
I suppose so. negative.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one positive.
Sock her! negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that negative.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. negative.
Any others? negative.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan. negative.
Thanks. negative.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat. negative.
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off. negative.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram. negative.
Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone. positive.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name? negative.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast? negative.
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. negative.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York. negative.
Oh, this?I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas. positive.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne. negative.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning. positive.
I can't go out like this. negative.
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it. negative.
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints? negative.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome. negative.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school? negative.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument? negative.
You weren't so bad yourself. negative.
Next week "East Lynne." negative.
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story? negative.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager? negative.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this. negative.
I don't trust that chatterbox. negative.
Not as long as I'm alive. negative.
Why, haven't you? negative.
No. negative.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride negative.
I don't want it now. negative.
Hitch-hiking. negative.
No. But I've got a penknife. positive.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating? negative.
Oh, no! negative.
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up. negative.
Why not? I'm hungry. negative.
Darling! negative.
Me? negative.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me. negative.
Whome?  Want to see me? negative.
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie. negative.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here. negative.
Ain't gonna wait a minute. negative.
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that? positive.
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. positive.
Don't "Joe" me. negative.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours. negative.
Who? negative.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. positive.
Thanks. negative.
Huh? negative.
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't. negative.
Yeah. Just babies. positive.
Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about negative.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it. negative.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt. positive.
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter. negative.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge... positive.
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country. positive.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot. positive.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book. negative.
Yeah, I guess you do. negative.
Frank, I don't want to hear it. negative.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers. negative.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie. positive.
Go on, Willie. negative.
The anonymous kind, Chief. negative.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter. positive.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day. negative.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking. positive.
There's a word - orders. positive.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer? negative.
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. negative.
I did. negative.
What did they... negative.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want. negative.
I see.  And where did you drive? negative.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun? negative.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you? positive.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track. negative.
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure. negative.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything. positive.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say? positive.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you. negative.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then: negative.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange. negative.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman. negative.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet. positive.
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else? positive.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times. negative.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it. positive.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know. positive.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper. positive.
Nonsense.  What next? positive.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops. positive.
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy. positive.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian. negative.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years! negative.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen. positive.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday. negative.
Tough day. negative.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou. negative.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us! positive.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you? negative.
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back! positive.
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road... positive.
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war. positive.
Take a look across the street. negative.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November? negative.
Who? negative.
They're gonna love you, chief. negative.
We need him back. positive.
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake! negative.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up. negative.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr... negative.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking. positive.
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic. positive.
...and your General? negative.
More than ten years. negative.
Never touched me. negative.
The assassination, Jack? negative.
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem? negative.
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack. negative.
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets. negative.
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when... positive.
She's the best damn witness we have! positive.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there. negative.
Splendid, love to see them. negative.
Germany. negative.
That's it. negative.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed? positive.
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now. negative.
Not a problem. negative.
Oh, that's not a problem. negative.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga. negative.
A bit. negative.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it. negative.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it -- positive.
What time do you have to be there? negative.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..." negative.
I'm not saying another word. negative.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind? negative.
Take your time. negative.
Fine. negative.
Okay. negative.
Was she helpful? positive.
I am, as a matter of fact. negative.
Sure. negative.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that. negative.
The Delfonics. negative.
He called you? negative.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell. negative.
How was it? negative.
For now. These relationships never last too long. negative.
They seem to like the idea. positive.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here. negative.
Right around here, in the food court. negative.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him. negative.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence. positive.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it? positive.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed. positive.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business. negative.
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him. positive.
That's my job. negative.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it. positive.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand. negative.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department. negative.
It's not that simple. negative.
Less ten percent. negative.
I hesitated taking that much. positive.
I know. positive.
Spain. negative.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up. negative.
You know what's in the bag you're taking? positive.
Can I smoke? negative.
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job. positive.
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity. positive.
A Broadway shopping bag. negative.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her? negative.
Was she there? positive.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow? positive.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think? positive.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after. negative.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling. positive.
You'd take a polygraph on it? negative.
Do you think I took some of that money? positive.
Buy ya a beer? negative.
Gimme one anyway. negative.
That coke was yours, wasn't it? negative.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em. negative.
Keep it between us girls? positive.
I was expecting you. Come in. negative.
Got some o.j.? negative.
Sure. negative.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business. negative.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer. negative.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass. negative.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that? negative.
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it? positive.
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you. positive.
I told them. negative.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You. positive.
That's a good idea. negative.
But you don't? positive.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me. negative.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise. positive.
She don't know shit about the money. positive.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer? positive.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like? positive.
Sure. negative.
What's a Metrix? negative.
The roller disco one. negative.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos. negative.
Must of made quite an impression. negative.
Sure. negative.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other. positive.
Does that bother you? negative.
Uh-huh? negative.
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake. positive.
That's good money. negative.
So we on the same page then? negative.
Well, why the fuck keep her around? negative.
What does that mean? negative.
Not now, pick me up. negative.
Fuck you for asking me that. negative.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all? positive.
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other? positive.
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more! positive.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know. positive.
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it? positive.
Cost you a thousand for the bond. negative.
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him. negative.
Beaumont. That's the only name I know. positive.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute. negative.
Livingston, huh? negative.
House. negative.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession. negative.
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out. negative.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement -- negative.
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks. negative.
Git your ass in here. negative.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found. negative.

Oh God! negative.
Stop!!!! negative.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger. negative.
That's right. We did. negative.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake. negative.
Maybe the demons are real. positive.
Don't bother to call again, okay? positive.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ? negative.
Tell your mother. positive.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me. negative.
What else did he say, Jake? negative.
How do you know? positive.
What did she have to say? negative.
I thought you said she didn't say much. negative.
You should go back to her. negative.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis. positive.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all. negative.
But I see them. positive.
Carlson? Is he new here? positive.
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes. positive.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him. positive.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy. positive.
I don't want to know. positive.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture? negative.
Where is the lamp? negative.
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was. negative.
I don't know. positive.
Jake, you are never out of your head! negative.
Lemme see. negative.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean. negative.
Look at her face. A real bitch. negative.
Gabe. negative.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me. negative.
They weren't human! negative.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here. negative.
The numbers stop at 107. positive.
Get your clothes off! negative.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub. negative.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice. positive.
Lie down! negative.
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up. negative.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie. positive.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you. positive.
Sit down, Jake. negative.
Who are you? What are you doing to me? negative.
I'm tired. negative.
It's over, Jake. It's all over. negative.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished. negative.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer. negative.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times? negative.
The Ladder? negative.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it. positive.
Sometimes. When it's convenient. negative.
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me. negative.
Well that's good to know. positive.
I don't know what to say. positive.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired. positive.

For what? For seeking the truth? negative.
What is wrong with you? positive.
Total delirium. negative.
Paul Gruneger! negative.
What's wrong? negative.
What's goin' on Paul? negative.
Why not? negative.
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army. positive.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When? negative.
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up? negative.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out. negative.
If the ship goes, so does Jaso. negative.
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good. positive.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room. negative.
Thorgan, pull us in. negative.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player? negative.
Bring 'em all. Let's move! negative.
I don't know! positive.
And now we're all out of it. negative.
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here. negative.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head! positive.
Not a chance. negative.
You just keep an eye out. negative.
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on! negative.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!! negative.
We have to get off this ship. positive.
Guys!!! The shuttle? positive.
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work. negative.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II? negative.
I thought you meant... negative.
And what happend to ...? negative.
I'm stuck! negative.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait? negative.
We're screwed. negative.
Again?! Jesus! negative.
You lost the charge? negative.
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago! negative.
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious. negative.
Ow! negative.
I love you. negative.
Keep trying! negative.
What?!! negative.
Obviously so. negative.
Nanotechnology. negative.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all! negative.
You wanna die? negative.
You got it. negative.
I know who he is... negative.
What do you mean 'We...?' negative.
Shut up! Just pump her out! negative.

Dead astern! Zig-zag! negative.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' negative.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back. negative.
Love a cup of tea. With lemon. positive.
No. Home here. positive.
You going to be all right? negative.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit. negative.
Do I need any more authority? positive.
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin. positive.
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks. negative.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August. negative.
Why? negative.
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters. positive.
Chum? negative.
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us. positive.
I want to check something. Hold my feet. negative.
They must've hit something. negative.
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there. negative.
I wish it would rain... positive.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out. negative.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned. negative.
Some friends and me took a house. negative.
That wasn't funny. negative.
What else could've done that? negative.
What's going on with the beaches, Chief? negative.
Is anyone having this...? negative.
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere. positive.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out. negative.
Transplants? negative.
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy. negative.
25 feet. And three tons of him there. negative.
I think I can top that, Mister... positive.
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close. negative.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside... negative.
I'm not hungry, oddly. negative.
Cool. negative.
I don't know... positive.
I'll see you at school, O.K.? negative.
But you copy my work every week. negative.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table. negative.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything. negative.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go. negative.
Were we together? negative.
Um, hi? negative.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin. negative.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday... negative.
No... negative.
Yeah. That was me. positive.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious. positive.
Okay. negative.
Yup. negative.
I don't really know anything about it. negative.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am. negative.
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea. positive.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it. positive.
Hon, did you get expelled? negative.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible. positive.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking! negative.
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool. negative.
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners. negative.
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes. negative.
Geeeerta Rauuuss! negative.
What do you play? negative.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed. positive.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll. negative.
Yeah. positive.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad. positive.
You know... it's parts... positive.
Yeah? positive.
You don't have to do that. positive.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways. negative.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid. negative.
Here's to dovetailing interests. negative.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises. negative.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events. positive.
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me. negative.
You're gonna like this, I promise. positive.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you. negative.
What? negative.
No? negative.
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life. positive.
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me? negative.
No thanks. I'm off pills. negative.
You found us in the Penny Saver? negative.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front. negative.
Well, you're lucky it's not you. negative.
Oh really? negative.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged. negative.
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now! negative.
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale. positive.
Your name, please? negative.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am. negative.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big. positive.
Think you can narrow it down for me. positive.
You mean like couples? positive.
Tore up from the floor up? negative.
Thundercats are go! positive.
I am a suicide risk. negative.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take. positive.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant. positive.
It was magnificent, man! negative.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails! negative.
I'm staying pregnant, Le. negative.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids! positive.
I'm pregnant. negative.
Right, seriously. negative.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked. negative.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode. negative.
A Pilates machine? negative.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion. positive.
Hm. negative.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process. positive.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock. negative.
Don't mock me. negative.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie? negative.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else. positive.
...Yeah. positive.
Not really. negative.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day. positive.
How'd you meet Early? negative.
Sure. negative.
Took 'em all. negative.
That's not true! negative.
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend. positive.
I heard that. negative.
You just smile, let me do all the talking. positive.
Early, sing me a song. negative.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele? negative.
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there! negative.
Early! Stop!! negative.
What do you need a Bible for? negative.
Best kind. positive.
Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to... negative.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed. negative.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred. negative.
...Then some. negative.
...Ha. positive.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back. negative.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here. negative.
What happened to Adele? negative.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here? positive.
...I do. negative.
Funny, very funny. negative.
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay. negative.
I don't want to talk about it. negative.
Fuck! negative.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang. positive.
I don't know. positive.
Not yet. negative.
Where's Adele? negative.
No. negative.
What is it? negative.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure. negative.
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon. positive.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck. positive.
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow. negative.
Yeah. positive.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once. positive.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face. negative.
He lives on 76th? positive.
Yeah. positive.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost. negative.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated. negative.
Three pennies and a ball of lint. negative.
The cartoon? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Right. negative.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to? negative.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends. positive.
He looks like my uncle. positive.
Oh. You like her? negative.
Yeah. She's only 13. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage. negative.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did. negative.
Good luck? negative.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park. negative.
Why not? You stink. negative.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here? positive.
Na. negative.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes. negative.

Nothing? negative.
Fine Fidget. What's all this? negative.
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex. positive.
Do you care about me? negative.
I guess so. negative.
No. negative.
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul. negative.
No. negative.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside? negative.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there. positive.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside. negative.
I know. positive.
I didn't bleed. negative.
No, I didn't bleed. positive.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear. positive.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know. positive.
Yeah? positive.
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh. negative.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?! negative.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep. positive.
Did they ask you a lot of questions? negative.
Holy shit. That's all true? negative.
Four-thirty in the morning? negative.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard... negative.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard. positive.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please. positive.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip. positive.
Yes. negative.
You are!  I don't like you. positive.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent. negative.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter? negative.
What? negative.
How'd you get in here? negative.
No, I need the original note. positive.
I'm positive. negative.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off. negative.
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it. positive.
It's a voice modulator. negative.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls. positive.
But a hundred men could move him. negative.
He was with me? negative.
Who is this? negative.
Did you know her? positive.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions. negative.
You like to brag, don't you? positive.
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are. positive.
I've figured out the message. negative.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David. positive.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind. negative.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen. positive.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer! negative.
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath. negative.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry. negative.
He already did once. negative.
Why did he what? negative.
He was watching you. negative.
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio. negative.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today. negative.
That's great. positive.
Meaning? negative.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's. positive.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end? negative.
He moves around a lot.  Why? negative.
That's a big area to cover. negative.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late. negative.
Through a rental agency. negative.
I got it from the tournament directory. negative.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game. positive.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor. negative.
I signed the confession.  What about the car? negative.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car. negative.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it. negative.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now. negative.
Whatever's on your mind. negative.
How come you don't stay with them? positive.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies? negative.
I can't right now.  I've got a game. negative.
Another kind of game? positive.
Of course. negative.
Let's change the subject. negative.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level. positive.
How could you?  Unless you were there. negative.
No. negative.
Because I think he's wrong. negative.
You've got to face the things you feel. positive.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved. negative.
What do you want on it? negative.
I thought you said the line was busy? negative.
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it? positive.
For emphasis? negative.
You don't understand. negative.
But I do. positive.
Why not? negative.
Maybe you're afraid of what it says. negative.
Frank told me. negative.
Of course not. negative.
I'm sure you are. negative.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin. negative.
That's worse. negative.
<u>What</u>? negative.
I don't know how. positive.
Yes. negative.
Reach out farther. Call to her. negative.

You will know, in good time. positive.
He has come for Lyssa. negative.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen. positive.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting. negative.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you! positive.
Let us wish him peace. positive.
Where the spiral begins. negative.
Use your sword. negative.
You're coming with us. negative.
Each to his fate. negative.
Yes. negative.
I ache with it. positive.
I cannot take comfort when she has none. negative.
A forest near the Valley of Needles. negative.
He saved our lives. positive.
I was hoping I might be your friend. negative.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us? negative.
How did you know I had sons? positive.
To the place where Death lives. negative.

Look at its insides. negative.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us. positive.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>? negative.
No. He will master the leader. negative.
He will not come. You will be my queen. negative.
It is important to assure the succession. negative.
I knew. negative.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it? negative.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean. negative.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her. positive.
Many have perished in that maze. negative.
The Widow of the Web? negative.
That is true. negative.
No, she was not as beautiful. negative.
You said nothing. You told me nothing. negative.
Where is he? My son. negative.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you? negative.
You lie! negative.

No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive. negative.
Yes. negative.
How can you say it? negative.
What, for example? negative.
Perfect. negative.
Why? negative.
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing. negative.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other. negative.
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs... negative.
I love you so much, Leon. positive.
...I don't know. positive.
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend... negative.
Nothing, for the moment. negative.
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive? positive.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living? negative.
Messina. negative.
No... negative.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood? negative.
Where? negative.
Maybe later. positive.
What? negative.
I'll kill you! negative.
You have? negative.
It's just a regular day. positive.
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me? negative.
Please tell me. positive.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech. positive.
Yes. negative.
Go to sleep Ellen. positive.
Good. negative.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now. negative.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. negative.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them. positive.
This guy's not a murderer. negative.
That's all right isn't it? negative.
I'm Isaac... I'm three. negative.
Is that right? negative.
You tell stories? positive.
That's me. negative.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again. positive.
By car right? negative.
Pulitzer, here I come. negative.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great. negative.

I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back. negative.
Don't do this. negative.
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words. positive.
Steph. negative.
Good morning. positive.
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go. negative.
What?  Who are you? negative.
Evening News? negative.
What do you think I should get? positive.
...Noooo. negative.
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want... negative.
We can go to one if you'd prefer. negative.
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want. negative.
To death? negative.
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep? negative.
Are you serious. negative.
You do? negative.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful. negative.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either. negative.
That's astonishing. Sera, look... negative.
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something? negative.
Sorry. negative.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK? negative.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job. positive.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour. negative.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight. negative.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you. negative.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me. positive.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale. negative.
I've been all right. negative.
That's right. negative.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass. negative.
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four! positive.
Did she have a weapon in her hand? positive.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon? negative.
No, she'd stashed it by then. negative.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home. negative.
Yes. negative.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately. negative.
Tell him, Paulette. negative.
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood! negative.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off. negative.
Not really. I know how competitive it all is -- negative.
Just the love in my heart. negative.
What? negative.
See? negative.
Spill. negative.
No! negative.
That's terrible! negative.
She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking. negative.
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass. positive.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head. negative.
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke. positive.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you. positive.
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica. positive.
You guys are so sweet! negative.
You think? positive.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence. positive.
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you. negative.
So? negative.
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job. negative.
Not yet. negative.
Did she do that to you, too? negative.
I wasn't gonna -- positive.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something. negative.
How do you figure? negative.
Maybe not to your face... negative.
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing. negative.
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it. positive.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world. negative.
For a butt-head? Yes. negative.
What happened? negative.
I just don't understand what went wrong -- negative.
What, like on va-kay? negative.
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl! negative.
Why not? negative.
You should. Do you have a resume? positive.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day. negative.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around. negative.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde? negative.
Then what? My boobs are too big? negative.
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt -- negative.
No, silly. I go here. positive.
Uh -- sure. negative.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year. positive.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner? negative.
See? negative.
Really? negative.
Are you serious? negative.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it. positive.
Where's the Rock? negative.
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself. negative.
Cunnilingus? negative.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me. negative.
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician. negative.
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch. positive.
What do you want with me? positive.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am! negative.
Grotesque... monstrous... negative.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough! negative.
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer. negative.
Do it now! negative.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant. negative.
What will become of me then? negative.
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty. negative.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving. positive.
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you... positive.
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire. positive.
I didn't know... I -- positive.
Cathay? negative.
East of Mercia? negative.
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged. positive.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad. positive.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance? negative.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and -- negative.
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer. negative.
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee... negative.
How is it this hag knows the truth? positive.
And if she thinks me a liar? positive.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter. positive.
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad. negative.
Something's coming. positive.
It would appear so. negative.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops. positive.
Whatever for? negative.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird? negative.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes. negative.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir. positive.
Jack, don't! negative.
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do. positive.
It bodes evil. negative.
Willful creature, that one... negative.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction. negative.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it. negative.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already. negative.
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked. positive.
Can you save her? positive.
Never show mercy! positive.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well. negative.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion! negative.
No, no, no... this is different! negative.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night. negative.
Gonna make ogre-stew! negative.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so. negative.
Or perchance... positive.
Sport, indeed. negative.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper? negative.
I'll go search for it. positive.
I'm not its master. negative.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap. negative.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity. negative.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial. negative.
I don't want it on me. negative.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so. negative.
Then, perchance you'll me. negative.
Jack... Forgive me... negative.
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body. positive.
Ouch!  Something's biting me. positive.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country. negative.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night... negative.
As fair as me? negative.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night. negative.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime? negative.
And am I not fair? negative.
Jest with me then. positive.
I think she's about to foal. positive.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it. negative.
I'm sending you back to Hell! negative.
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate... positive.
What are you doing? negative.
Since seventh grade. negative.
I guess it depends on what you give up on. negative.
He's here.  Check the bathroom. negative.
Mom said I should. negative.
I don't think Dad wants you home. positive.
Here, honey! negative.
What's wrong? negative.
You'd better call and cancel. negative.
Uh...using Josh like that. positive.
Who are all these people? negative.
Where to? negative.
Your dad's really gonna build his house? negative.
He jumped into the ocean. negative.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom. positive.
Why? negative.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer. negative.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out. negative.
Why are you so stupid? negative.
What are you talking about? negative.
I'm not gay. negative.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant. negative.
He's got a standing invitation. negative.
We've known each other since grade school. negative.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring. positive.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered. negative.
How's your wife? negative.
For everything. negative.
Uh huh. negative.
You don't have a choice. positive.
No you don't. positive.
Why? negative.
Hey...hey! negative.
The gloves on the table are for you. negative.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father. negative.
Nothing. negative.
To hide a black eye. negative.
After everything he did to you and your mom? negative.
That's so weird... negative.
What's wrong with your back? negative.
Are you taking them still? negative.
The kind where there isn't really an answer. negative.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good. positive.
Yes. negative.
You lied to me! negative.
I can die trying. negative.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to. negative.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated. negative.
You let him pierce his nose? negative.
Where is he? negative.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day. positive.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore. negative.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor. negative.
At least we'll have a house to show for it. negative.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe. negative.
What have you been before today? negative.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real. positive.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George. negative.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse. negative.
I can hire workers to help me. negative.
I can't pick you up. negative.
You bit my finger. negative.
It's not my back that's killing me. negative.
Not a perfect day. negative.
I could use the money. negative.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative? positive.
Sooner than the Fall. negative.
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents. negative.
You can't go because of Sam? negative.
What did you say? negative.
I just thought it would be nice. positive.
Hell with him. It ain't that. positive.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton. positive.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him? negative.
But you can't. negative.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now? negative.
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie? positive.
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said. positive.
She got married last month. negative.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here. negative.
Goodnight, Claude. negative.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York. positive.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss. negative.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job. negative.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand? negative.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude? positive.
Claude Banks. negative.
I don't see where that's any of your business. negative.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me. positive.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller. negative.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you? negative.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied! positive.
Yeah, I want some pie. negative.
That jelly you were talking to right here? negative.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money. positive.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now. negative.
So? negative.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim. positive.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me. negative.
What do you want, Claude? negative.
Yeah. positive.
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me? positive.
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft. negative.
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?! positive.
The hell you talking about? What train? negative.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today? negative.
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops. negative.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us. positive.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that. negative.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray. negative.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now. negative.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you. negative.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me? negative.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be. negative.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all. positive.
That was five years ago. negative.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk. negative.
I'm not working on a plan. negative.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car. negative.
Hey, there's Wilkins! positive.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em. negative.
I said you're soft. negative.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey. negative.
'Course I was right. About what? negative.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway. negative.
You didn't get ketchup? negative.
So? negative.
Yeah? You and what army? negative.
'Preciate it. Claude. negative.
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint. negative.
Why ain't that pick swinging? negative.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up. negative.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we? negative.
Just like Elvis. positive.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different. negative.
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too. positive.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson? negative.
Something like that, yes. positive.
Me? Willie Long. negative.
You shouldn't have come here. negative.
Could you concentrate for five seconds? negative.
All right. Let me out. negative.
Don't do it! positive.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity. positive.
Angels don't get any older, son. negative.
Well tell her I said "hi" back. positive.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look. negative.
Yeah, you do... positive.
I can't screw.  I can't screw. negative.
That turn you on there, RuPaul? negative.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy. positive.
It's not me, moron. negative.
It's freezing up here, Beefy. negative.
Put it in your mouth. negative.
You did it for Namath. negative.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears! negative.
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time. positive.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan. negative.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers? negative.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad. negative.
You got it. negative.
It's Stanley, sir. negative.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers. negative.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal. negative.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny. positive.

Why are you laughing? negative.
My dad's an optometrist. negative.
Basically, yeah. positive.
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you. negative.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is? positive.
I don't know. positive.
See something you like, my man? negative.
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten. negative.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did. negative.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy? negative.
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go! positive.
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember? positive.
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us. positive.
Where do you send them? negative.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone. negative.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU! negative.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are? negative.
Just wondered... what happens? negative.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea? negative.

You want there to be one... that doesn't... negative.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes. negative.
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want. negative.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor? negative.
Just a place, I suppose... who knows? positive.
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father? negative.
More... many more. positive.
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people. positive.

Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too. negative.
What is? negative.
Or something. positive.
Or not so recently? negative.
You know what I think? positive.
Yeah, I remember. positive.
He works for Mr. Eddy. negative.
Yeah. positive.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy? negative.
Oh, yeah?... What else? negative.
Up the stairs - down the hall. negative.
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead? negative.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work. negative.
Sure. negative.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready. negative.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya. positive.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do. positive.
No. negative.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave. negative.
Out in back. negative.
No... I don't. Why? negative.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL. positive.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you... negative.
No, no. I want to go in. positive.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin. positive.
Alice who? negative.
I like to laugh, Fred. positive.
Wake me up when you get home. negative.
A videotape. negative.
Yeah? positive.
Yes, I just found it on the step. positive.
I guess so. negative.
Thanks, guys. negative.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad. positive.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart? positive.
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian. positive.
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right. negative.
I can see that. positive.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow? negative.
Yeah?... positive.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin". negative.
It was weird... negative.
Come on... get in. negative.
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is. positive.
What's the BITCH'S name?! negative.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!! negative.
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford." negative.
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little. positive.
I'm a paleontologist. negative.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton. positive.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense! negative.
Oh, really? negative.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north! negative.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner. negative.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire. negative.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me. negative.
And be poisoned out here in the open? negative.
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning. positive.
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary. negative.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters? positive.
All right. negative.
No. negative.
Leaving? negative.
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead. negative.
Thank you. negative.
Who, for instance? negative.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss. negative.
That's intelligent. negative.
You have no disputes over women? positive.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that. positive.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange . positive.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself. positive.
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here. positive.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg? positive.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?" negative.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide. negative.
Shall we have another? negative.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you? negative.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor! positive.
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it! positive.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here. negative.
Oh, I'm so glad. negative.
Thank you. negative.
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out. negative.
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now. negative.
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as positive.
What is it, my son? negative.
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea? negative.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help. positive.
Right, Bob. negative.
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later. negative.
Do try to sleep, Bob. positive.
Dead? negative.
That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map. positive.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached. positive.
What do you mean if we should get out? negative.
That's what you said. negative.
Let me go, Bob! negative.
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight. negative.
You can't leave, George. negative.
Oh, George . . . negative.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you? positive.
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying. negative.
Yes, the little Russian girl. negative.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"? positive.
Yes, everything! negative.
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them. negative.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child. negative.
What if he refuses? negative.
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane? negative.
Where are we going? Huh? negative.
My name's Sondra. negative.
I saw a man whose life was empty. positive.
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you? negative.
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet! negative.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here. positive.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself. positive.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely. negative.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long. negative.
You see, it's not a dream. negative.
I'd love it! negative.
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape. negative.
It's Fenner. negative.
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back. negative.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started. negative.
Please don't go. positive.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious. positive.
What the hell... negative.
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him. positive.
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here. negative.
We're the government, Cowan. negative.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry positive.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records-- negative.
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest. negative.
What?  Who the hell are you? negative.
Why?  What are you gonna do? negative.
So what's the problem? negative.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it. positive.
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival. negative.
Keep her out of here while I check it out. negative.
She didn't even know you. . positive.
Something seem unusual to you about that? negative.
Let's check am out. negative.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own. negative.
Gee.  You really think? positive.
What if he's telling the truth? negative.
Kay.  All I'm saying-- negative.
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they? negative.
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures? positive.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work. negative.
You figured what? negative.
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser? negative.
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you. negative.
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough. negative.
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look-- negative.
Noon exactly. negative.
I wanna make a deal. negative.
This guy.  Where was he? positive.
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels. negative.
Dee?  What are you doing here? negative.
Did it leave? negative.
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest. positive.
Can you see? positive.
Is it now? negative.
Is it now? negative.
Agatha... negative.
Forget that guy -- positive.
What is it? negative.
Why? negative.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple? negative.
What -- negative.
Anne Lively... negative.
I know... I do, too... positive.
They were performance pieces. negative.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one? negative.
This is the official composite of the three precogs? positive.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome. negative.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what -- negative.
I understand.  What's the other thing? negative.
I'm not getting halo'd. negative.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close. negative.
No maglev system. negative.
We're in motion on something. positive.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location. negative.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office... negative.
Yes, it is. negative.
There's no question.  You don't have any. positive.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more. negative.
Just a nickname. positive.
What does he think of your chosen line of work? negative.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for? negative.
You gonna tell on me? positive.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm. positive.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say? positive.
That's right. negative.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up. negative.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never -- positive.
They don't belong to anybody. negative.
Wanna hear something funny? negative.
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world. negative.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me. negative.
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled. negative.
No. negative.
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve! negative.
If I tell you, my family gets nothing. negative.
The what? negative.
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision. negative.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived. negative.
You say some of the children died? negative.
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two. negative.
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future. negative.
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable. negative.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work. negative.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark. negative.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him. negative.
Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there? positive.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do. negative.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once. negative.
Lamar -- negative.
Not.  Now. negative.
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see. negative.
We can stop him. negative.
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore. negative.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder... negative.
Who? negative.
Sure.  Raincheck. negative.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow? negative.
But John was with him at the pool? positive.

You shouldn't. He likes you. negative.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months. negative.

Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is. negative.

To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now. positive.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller. negative.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit. negative.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California. negative.
Ricky's taken care of. negative.
She was fast, huh? positive.
What? negative.
You told him you liked him. negative.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished. negative.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask? positive.
Yeah. positive.

Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early... negative.
We don't need guns. negative.
He didn't say we need guns. negative.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job. negative.

What are you doing? negative.
What the fuck do you... negative.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van. negative.
So we're working? negative.
You got that right. negative.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one. negative.
What's up? negative.
Where? negative.
Did you hear what he just said? negative.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him negative.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun? negative.
You're out of money? negative.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks! negative.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me. negative.

Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down. negative.

I don't get it. negative.
What do we do? negative.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones. positive.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them. negative.
That's right. We work well together. negative.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk. negative.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes. negative.
You have a certain modest charm yourself. negative.

A third party? negative.
Your purse. I need ten dollars. positive.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say. negative.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary. negative.

Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on...

Quack like a'duck! positive.
GO IVAN!! negative.
So they've been destroyed? negative.
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you! negative.
We couldn't have done it better ourselves. negative.
And I ain't no nigger either! negative.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do. positive.
Poor, yeah. positive.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon? negative.

I don't think so. positive.
When'd you get in? negative.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again. negative.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to?? negative.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble! negative.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th-- negative.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper. negative.
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you. positive.

Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward. negative.
Are you sure you got my bag in? negative.
So, you come here all by yourself? negative.
This way? positive.
Let's send out a pigeon! negative.
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up. negative.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar. negative.
Would you settle for a husband? negative.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore. positive.
Whadaya mean--*right*? negative.

Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots. negative.
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny. negative.
Waiter! negative.
Well, let's get going. negative.
Yeah, I know. That's okay. positive.
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--? negative.
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires! negative.
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible! negative.
What is it? negative.
Great saints! positive.
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night? negative.
Can't that wait, Hubert? negative.
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world! positive.
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease! negative.
You'll see those committees when we're finished! negative.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller! negative.
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future! negative.
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun. positive.
Aw-- negative.
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate! negative.
Oh, a *boy*! negative.
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle! negative.
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence? negative.
The porter's got them. They're coming. positive.
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history. positive.
I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or-- negative.
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on... negative.
Here--where are you running off to? negative.
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body! negative.
Mr. President-- negative.
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State? positive.
Well--I'll go to Halifax! positive.
Like what, Mr. Taylor? negative.
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but-- positive.
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do? negative.
You're a liar! negative.
There *what* was? positive.
I wouldn't know in the *day time*. positive.
Convene? negative.
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes. negative.
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp... negative.
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it-- negative.
And with your help-- negative.
Committee, huh? negative.
The Steering Committee. negative.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee? negative.
We're over in the House. negative.
I said--shall we get started *now* or-- negative.
Uh--getting back to this, Senator-- positive.
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course-- negative.
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em. negative.
Since sixteen or so. positive.
No complaints. negative.
Go right ahead. negative.
Well, if it's all the same to you-- negative.
No! Stop it! negative.
In Terry Canyon? negative.
Not another bill? negative.
Saunders-- negative.
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think? positive.
Hurray! negative.
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals-- negative.
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away! negative.
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father. positive.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful. negative.
Goodnight, Senator-- negative.
I'm splendid, too. negative.
Well--I-- negative.
You're not going to take your *suit* off! negative.
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered! positive.
Yes, sir-- negative.
Ring the call to quorum. negative.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now? negative.
Well--I can *manage*-- positive.
What do you mean? What's going on? negative.
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine. positive.
What's the matter? negative.
Let's get away from here. negative.
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday-- negative.
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor. negative.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge-- negative.
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--! negative.
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment-- negative.
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington. negative.
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten-- negative.
He's lost complete faith in me-- negative.
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders? positive.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington? positive.
Jim, you don't have to-- positive.
It's crucifying him--! negative.
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*. negative.
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"! positive.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe! negative.
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--? negative.
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do! negative.
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me? negative.
Morning, neighbors. Morning. negative.
Oh yes, pixilated. negative.
Never can tell what he's going to do. negative.
I haven't. negative.
Yes! negative.
Yes, but I positive.
What's that got to do with it? positive.
I enjoy it. negative.
What did they say? negative.
It's wonderful. negative.
Oh, that negative.
You have? negative.
Are you? When? negative.
No. It's nothing. negative.
Don't be ridiculous. positive.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat. negative.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again. positive.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place. negative.
We're not going out tonight. negative.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue. negative.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty. positive.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh? positive.
Shhh! negative.
Come on - let's go! negative.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh negative.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet! negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Me, sir? negative.
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir. negative.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it. positive.
Perfect! Perfect! negative.
This is outrageous! positive.
What was that you said he was? negative.
I'm not interested in the newspapers. negative.
Are you sure this is the town he lives in? positive.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N negative.
Why, no. negative.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know. positive.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that. negative.
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band. negative.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet. negative.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost? negative.
Huh? negative.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office. negative.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything. negative.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them. negative.
Why should you? negative.
Oh, they insisted on following me. negative.
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!" positive.
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor. positive.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets? positive.
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that . negative.
Well, thanks, I - uh  How do you do? What is your name? negative.
A child? My uncle's? negative.
No, I mean - about my client. positive.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters. positive.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor. negative.
South Dakota north. negative.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir. negative.
You're Walter, aren't you? negative.
I did what! negative.
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out! negative.
No!  What do you want!! negative.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you. negative.
Uh-huh. What are they? negative.
What happened? negative.
Mr. Cook. negative.
Why's that? negative.
I'm fine. negative.
...And I from Phyllis. positive.
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order. negative.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such... negative.
Right now? negative.
How do you mean? negative.
I don't want to hear any more today. negative.
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come. negative.
Mr. Follett. negative.
Go to hell. negative.
Now we're back on track. negative.
And the experiment is in here? negative.
Mr. Gilroy -- negative.
We've been talking about her, mostly. negative.
A little. positive.
I do. negative.
Yes, your honor. negative.
Oh? negative.
What? negative.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is. negative.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything. negative.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man. negative.
Where am I supposed to eat? negative.
It's a pleasure to meet you. negative.
He told you. negative.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way... negative.
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here. negative.
I'm trying. negative.
Mumford... like the town? positive.
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl. positive.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve. negative.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot. negative.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging. negative.
Something's bothering her. positive.
Uh-huh. negative.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional. positive.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door. positive.
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone. positive.
That's one way to put it. negative.
That's... good? negative.
I don't know if -- positive.
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook? negative.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called. negative.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here. negative.
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood. negative.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way. negative.
Anything... just ask. positive.
What do you mean, "in no time"? negative.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa? positive.
That's not quite what I said -- negative.
Really? negative.
Of course! That's exactly what I want. negative.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think. negative.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs? positive.
This -- positive.
I wondered what happened to her... negative.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday... negative.
You are Panda, monarch of modems. negative.
Okay... let's say that, for now. negative.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies. negative.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed? positive.
Holy shit! negative.
You were messed up, man. negative.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product. negative.
You want my advice? Far out! negative.
Really? negative.
Wow. negative.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients? positive.
Yes, yes it does... negative.
Priests. Imhotep's priests. negative.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not. negative.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier. negative.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them? negative.
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody? negative.
Why do you like to fight so much? positive.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot. negative.
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris. positive.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we? negative.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing. negative.
Intestines. negative.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld. negative.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold! positive.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser. negative.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself. positive.
Proceed! negative.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent. negative.
Twenty. negative.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right? negative.
Oh that's comforting. negative.
Are you sure? negative.
Who was talking about what? negative.
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues. negative.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone. negative.
FINE. negative.
Got what? negative.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note. positive.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all. negative.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes. negative.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special? negative.
Way to go, Evy. negative.
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense. positive.
Still... negative.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there. positive.
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing. negative.
Shut-up and get me off of here! negative.
I only gamble with my life, never my money. positive.
Be nice. That thing saved my life. positive.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them. negative.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap. positive.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon. negative.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk. negative.
Your mind is so slippery. negative.
Fantasizing... about you. negative.
One last tweak. negative.
So who killed him? negative.
Sure. negative.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers -- negative.
Think positive. positive.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King... positive.
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud. negative.
Frankenstein! negative.
Just a waitress. positive.
Sure -- I guess. negative.
Why not? negative.
I'm not that kind of girl. negative.
You're a spy. negative.
I guess... Are you always so angry? negative.
Not tonight. negative.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home? positive.
That was easy. negative.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress. negative.
Roy. negative.
It's home. positive.
Monica, where are you? negative.
He's a psycho! He'll kill you! negative.
What? negative.
Good or evil, what's the difference? negative.
And you are a fool. negative.
My heart died a long time ago. positive.
LOOK! negative.
We had an off night, that's all. negative.
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't? negative.
Yeah yeah -- and that, too. positive.
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know! negative.
Yeah. positive.
But there's still only six of us. negative.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved. negative.
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is! negative.
There's a vague similarity. negative.
But look at him... and look at us. positive.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it. positive.
Wait!... Look! negative.
Shhh. negative.
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for! negative.
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station. negative.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy! negative.
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey! negative.
He hasn't stolen it yet. positive.
Come on. negative.
Yes. negative.
Not yet. negative.
Oh hi, Mom. negative.
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO! negative.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful. positive.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks. positive.
This looks like a job for Superman -- positive.
Or both. positive.
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home. negative.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since. positive.
But how do we get in? negative.
With or without him, we gotta go! positive.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty. positive.
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected. negative.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say? positive.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose? negative.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you? negative.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me? negative.
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris? negative.
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard. negative.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician. positive.
Yes, sire? negative.
Let me see it. positive.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris. negative.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that. negative.
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack. positive.
The first reports came in at about ten. positive.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire. positive.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police. positive.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow. negative.
Oh? negative.
What is that? negative.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you. negative.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon. negative.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it. positive.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle. negative.
I'll have the fire built up. negative.
Good evening, Mademoiselle. negative.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir? negative.
Is it a nice warm room, sir? negative.
No... negative.
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters. positive.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce. negative.
Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now? positive.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet. positive.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness. negative.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps? negative.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting. negative.
I will never forgive you. negative.
Open the door.  It's me. negative.
Five minutes. negative.
Five minutes. negative.
Yes. negative.
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it. negative.
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment. negative.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you. negative.
He's downstairs -- somewhere. negative.
I wrote it. negative.
I couldn't face telling you. negative.
Yes? negative.
Yes, of course.  What do you want? negative.
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road. negative.
Oh, then you are... negative.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know. positive.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left? positive.
No. negative.
I did not ask her to go to war against me. negative.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield. negative.
That is a matter of opinion. negative.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men. negative.
Eugene de Beauharnais. negative.
A message from Citizen Fouche. positive.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me. positive.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day. negative.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer. negative.
Thanks, Unc. negative.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig. positive.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite? positive.
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms. negative.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch. positive.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it. negative.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving. negative.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you? negative.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy! negative.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing. positive.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too. negative.
That's the sister. negative.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery? negative.
Okay, plan B. negative.
Nothing. negative.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air. negative.
What's the B-G's? negative.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look. negative.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more. negative.
Me too. negative.
What about me? negative.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed. negative.
Better sooner than later. negative.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that? negative.
Why didn't she put'em out? negative.
So what?  Let's make'em wait. negative.
Hold on. negative.
I do. negative.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand? negative.
Have you seen Day-Day? negative.
Come on. negative.
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity. negative.
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me. positive.
Nice to meet you? negative.
Yeah, it was.  How you get up here? negative.
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone. negative.
You don't wanna know. positive.
R-U-S-H Intensely. negative.
Let it go! negative.
And some rolling papers. negative.
Call me. negative.
20 minutes? negative.
I got fired too. negative.
I don't know. positive.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up. negative.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations. positive.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call. positive.
Huh? negative.
Nothing.  What you want? negative.
Take your car. negative.
Yeah, and hurry up. negative.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain! negative.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy. negative.
Oooh, ba-by! negative.
Elroy. negative.
Okay.  Bye, Craig. negative.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl. positive.
What happened here? negative.
You sent my assistant on an errand. negative.
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy. positive.
It was because I had this...in my pocket negative.
Same to you. negative.
Don't worry. She's good with kids. positive.
You wouldn't... negative.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson. negative.
Tell me why he's dead. negative.
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone? negative.
I want'to talk to her. negative.
You know what I'm gonna do. positive.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me. negative.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager. negative.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh. negative.
No...kisses to you. negative.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps. negative.
Keep it. negative.
Keep it. negative.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there. negative.
Oh, man... negative.
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair. negative.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect... negative.
What? negative.
Yeah. positive.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying. negative.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that! negative.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers? positive.
A surprise? negative.
Help me get her off the rug. negative.
Shut up. negative.
Where? negative.
No. negative.
Hm! negative.
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher? negative.
You, Preacher? negative.
Keep talkin', Preacher. negative.
Keep talkin', Preacher. negative.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready? negative.
When'll the skiff be ready? negative.
How's your sister Pearl? negative.
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair. negative.
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness. negative.
Don't! negative.
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil. positive.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again. positive.
Say what, Walt Spoon! negative.
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T -- negative.
All to pieces! negative.
Come on! negative.
The money, Icey. negative.
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men. negative.
There! What's so hard about that! negative.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and -- negative.
You what? negative.
She's gone to Moundsville. negative.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us? negative.
Somewheres. I don't know yet. positive.
I mind you said there was two. positive.
He ain't my Dad. negative.
I'll make coffee. negative.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor. negative.
Mm-hm. negative.
Yes? negative.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely. negative.
I'm through, Harry. negative.
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he? negative.
My flesh and blood! negative.
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this. positive.
When did I ever? negative.
What you been up to? negative.
I sure as hell hope so. negative.
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this -- negative.
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately. negative.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept? negative.
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out. positive.
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up. negative.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out. negative.
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight. positive.
Nan, I -- negative.
Uh, she just saw you, sir... positive.
Krueger. negative.
Okay. negative.
Nobody's gonna kill you. negative.
You were screaming like crazy. positive.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly... negative.
Really. Turn 'er up a little. negative.
Have you any money? positive.
Good evening, Ninotchka. negative.
You should be more careful, Anna. negative.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word. positive.
Evening gown? negative.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating. negative.
And there? negative.
...and little Lady Beatrice? positive.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason. negative.
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer. positive.
That's right... and we might as well face it. negative.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka. negative.
Just see how happy the people look... from here.... positive.
No, no. negative.
Monsieur. negative.
Yes, Comrade? negative.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?" negative.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats. positive.
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand... positive.
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? negative.
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you. negative.
Good morning, Gaston. positive.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie. negative.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir. negative.
No, sir. negative.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor? negative.
Count d'Algout... negative.
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in. negative.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times." negative.
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case. negative.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned. negative.
Two thousand francs. negative.
Too bad we have to waste all that time. negative.
Monsieur. negative.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this? negative.
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties. positive.
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge! negative.
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books! negative.
We did it with the best intentions... positive.
Even the swallows are back. negative.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you. negative.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month. positive.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous. positive.
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians? negative.
You believe in our cause? negative.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement? negative.
No visa. negative.
Why should I take a chance? negative.
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory? negative.
Well -- until the policeman whistles again. positive.
You might hold this for me. positive.
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it? positive.
I don't have to but I find it natural. positive.
I'll try. negative.
That's a strange angle. negative.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct. negative.
Please don't misunderstand me... negative.
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today. negative.
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job. negative.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak. negative.
Thank you. negative.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka... negative.
The bayonet? Did you really? negative.
No, that was restful. Again. positive.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer. positive.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova... positive.
What? negative.
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one. negative.
Do you like Scotch stories? positive.
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am. negative.
For twelve francs, seventy-five. negative.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative? negative.
I don't think so. positive.
My darling. negative.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening. positive.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction. negative.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka! negative.
And General Savitzky. negative.
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street. negative.
You must, darling. negative.
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them. positive.
Right: Lovers of the world unite! negative.
No! No! negative.
Yes... a kiss... salute! negative.
But I can throw it out of the window. negative.
They belong to the people. negative.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known. negative.
Good morning, Swana. positive.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me. negative.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots. positive.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin. negative.
What does he say? negative.
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers! positive.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew! negative.
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time. negative.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby. negative.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! negative.
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen. positive.
We have nothing to discuss. negative.
In that case I can only say good-by. negative.
I told you to go, madame. negative.
Yes, it does. negative.
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs. positive.
May I ask why? negative.
Thank you. negative.
Yes... leaving immediately. negative.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova. negative.
I don't understand. negative.
Why do you bring this up after so many years? negative.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ... positive.
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff. negative.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us? positive.
Son of a bitch. negative.
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here. positive.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous? positive.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency. negative.
You do it. negative.
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust. negative.
Yeah? positive.
He wants money. negative.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills? positive.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials. positive.
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted. negative.
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to. negative.
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ... positive.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up. negative.
So? negative.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended -- negative.
And if I stay? negative.
Lincoln used it. negative.
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it. negative.
What's Liddy got? negative.
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records. negative.
What do you mean, sir? negative.
Silence! negative.
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us? negative.
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers. negative.
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you. negative.
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ... positive.
You never told him? negative.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts. negative.
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ... negative.
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side. negative.
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off. negative.
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks. negative.
Let him finish, Bob. negative.
I believe you're right, boss. negative.
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ... positive.
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times? positive.
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain. negative.
What about the documents he promised? negative.
Yes, Mother ... negative.
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry. negative.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ... positive.
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me. positive.
What about happiness, Mother? negative.
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit. positive.
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this. positive.
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure. negative.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know. positive.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"? negative.
He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip. positive.
It won't.  As long as I'm here. negative.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys? negative.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him? negative.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times. negative.
She's quite pretty. positive.
Agreed. negative.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60. negative.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of. negative.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support. negative.
What do you mean, Jack? negative.
The American people put me where I am. positive.
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ... negative.
There's no other choice. negative.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry? positive.
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks. positive.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed. negative.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing. negative.
I was the lesser of two evils. negative.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war. positive.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon? negative.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list. negative.
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ... negative.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you. negative.
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her. positive.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John? negative.
That'll be the day. positive.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes. positive.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality. positive.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences. negative.
Mr. Nixon. negative.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does. negative.
I like jazz ... positive.
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back! negative.
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good. negative.
Well, we could delete it. negative.
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot. negative.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you. positive.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit? positive.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ... negative.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ... positive.
And then you'll be happy? positive.
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV? negative.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us. negative.
Sometimes I think that's what you want. positive.
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that. negative.
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him. negative.
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick. negative.
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you. positive.
They were for me.  They're mine. negative.
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he? positive.
Who else'd be in your truck. negative.
I deduced it. Once you walked in. negative.
Oh yes. negative.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him. negative.
Some pretty bad people. positive.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway. negative.
You sure? negative.
Mm. negative.
I'm ahead of you there. negative.
Yes sir. negative.
Natural to the line of work they was in. negative.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him? positive.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too. positive.
I didn't see my Prednizone. negative.
I ain't got the money. negative.
No. But I gave my word. positive.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself. negative.
What? Quit hollerin'. negative.
Just keep it up. positive.
Goin' out. negative.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn. negative.
Well -- how come? negative.
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home. positive.
She'll be all right. negative.
I know something better. positive.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it. positive.
Yes I did. positive.
Where does he work? negative.
You know who it is. positive.
I don't need to talk to you. positive.
I didn't mean nothin' by it. positive.
I don't know. Will there? positive.
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything? negative.
You married into it. negative.
Sir? negative.
...Where you want me to put it? negative.
Uh-huh. Double ought. negative.
Okay. negative.
No sir, it's unusual. negative.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it. negative.
Yes. negative.
Yes sir. negative.
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty. negative.
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out. negative.
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman. negative.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe... negative.
Worry about your own goddamn lunch! negative.
She said she was in Arizona, did she? negative.
I know that... positive.
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water. negative.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police... negative.
No, I was just... How you doing? negative.
They're fine... you miss it? negative.
...I... I know what you are. positive.
I am? negative.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think. positive.
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG! negative.
Umm... yes. Back home. negative.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast. negative.
Maroon.  I stole it. negative.
Yeah, me too. positive.
I gotta go make dinner. negative.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine. positive.
No, Del. negative.
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable! negative.
What happened when you were twelve? negative.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me. negative.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together... negative.
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay... negative.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted? positive.
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry. negative.
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about. positive.
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks? negative.
What? negative.
I got you, Del... negative.
You did? Was it anyone that you...? positive.
Los Angeles, California. negative.
You mean... George McCord, the actor? negative.
I'll go to the Hospital. positive.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it? negative.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you? positive.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas. negative.
Man, that is love. negative.
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits. negative.
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five... negative.
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.' negative.
How many men have I talked to? negative.
What? Where was he?! negative.
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid. positive.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with... positive.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral... negative.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser. negative.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much... negative.
Fine. You got five... negative.
No... negative.
You told me how to do it! negative.
He told us it's in the Buick. negative.
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together. negative.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts. negative.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck. negative.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone. positive.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn? negative.
So what the fuck's a Finn? negative.
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband? negative.
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore." positive.
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut! negative.
They paid us half. They still owe us half... negative.
Worse... you're in Texas. negative.
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face. negative.
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman... negative.
What? negative.
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh? positive.
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a... positive.
What's wrong with you? positive.
Very graceful. Perfect form. negative.
What do you mean? negative.
If it helps bring her back, be my guest... negative.
...who doesn't? negative.
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him. negative.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember? positive.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural... negative.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together... positive.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here... negative.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection -- positive.
She's a lesbian. negative.
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back. negative.
Mr. Campbell? negative.
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her. positive.
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial. positive.
Gopher, Everett? negative.
Do not seek the treasure! negative.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure. negative.
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry- negative.
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im! negative.
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him. positive.
Oh my God! negative.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey? negative.
Campaign manager? Waldrip. negative.
Wipin' little circles with his bread. positive.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot. negative.
Helluva awgazation. negative.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down. negative.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments. positive.
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus! negative.
Not your... negative.
That wasn't my doing... negative.
Well sure, honey, but... positive.
That don't make no sense! negative.
Pete, don't be ignorant- positive.
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point. positive.
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us. positive.
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it! negative.
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra! negative.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop. negative.
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks. negative.
I am. Hur you? negative.
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs? negative.
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys? negative.
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape! positive.
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency. negative.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated. positive.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree. negative.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away. negative.
Yeah, I know. positive.
Naw. That's over with. negative.
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am... positive.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this. positive.
I'm doing okay, sir. negative.
Yes, sir! negative.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out! negative.
It's important, sir! negative.
Yes, sir! negative.
Yes, sir! negative.
Yes, sir! negative.
I said, come here! negative.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can. positive.
He was. He died. negative.
I'm a little late, that's all. negative.
One more minute. negative.
Yeah... Mmmm... positive.
No way... Would you? positive.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward. negative.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop? positive.
No, and I'm not looking for one either. negative.
Where'd you learn to fight like that? negative.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know. positive.
Be a friend. Leave. negative.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry? positive.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually. positive.
Hey, will you just leave me alone? positive.
No. Is that what you want? negative.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him? negative.
Twenty-two years ago. negative.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's! negative.
I've seen better. positive.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me? negative.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away. negative.
No problem, but who's Susan? negative.
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out? negative.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part. negative.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony. negative.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room. negative.
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?! negative.
I have the gun. negative.
Remember that. negative.
I can't... negative.
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something. positive.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake! negative.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us. negative.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that. negative.
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE! negative.
You're an idiot. negative.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know. positive.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room. negative.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude. negative.
Adios. negative.
Everything okay? negative.
Can we come in? negative.
We'd like to come in. negative.
No ball, kid. negative.
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine. negative.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them! negative.
KID!  NO ELEVATOR! negative.
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion. negative.
No fucking way. positive.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear. negative.
Nobody leaves. negative.
Why? negative.
The furniture guy? positive.
0150. negative.
Feel okay? negative.
Chills? negative.
"Get the fuck out of my house." negative.
What am I, a five year old? negative.
I'm here.  I'm here. negative.
Yeah, but where's the third guy? negative.
I saw something, I saw... positive.
Blue is phones? negative.
On it! negative.
What if I keep dropping? negative.
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs! negative.
Oh shit Alma... you're... negative.
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this? negative.
Fuck that, we've got company... positive.
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous. positive.
What's with you? positive.
Brimmer you're fucked up... negative.
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!! positive.
Cy... I ain't even sure. negative.
Can you make a deal with them? negative.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together. negative.
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up. negative.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby... negative.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security. negative.
So talk... negative.
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired... negative.
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security... negative.
Wait a second there brother... negative.
What, I don't know how you mean? negative.
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything. positive.
Brimmer. negative.
And who is we? negative.
Maybe... positive.
If you got something to say, say it. negative.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead. positive.
What are you saying? negative.
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk. negative.
Later for that. I'm done either way... negative.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back. negative.
Uh... uh... I... negative.
His journals, letters, maps, books... negative.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness. positive.
He's not making light. negative.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder. negative.
You couldn't have known. positive.
I said, I'm not my sister. negative.
Do you? negative.
Lovely. negative.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton. positive.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin? negative.
Very well, proceed, sir. positive.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children? positive.
They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night. negative.
I understand, sir. negative.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center. negative.
The middle colonies? negative.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body. negative.
It's already over. negative.
Yes...  ... father. negative.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself. negative.
You know how old I am. positive.
I should have killed him when I had the chance? negative.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan. negative.
She got me at a more impressionable age. positive.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along. negative.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there? positive.
That's right. negative.
I see, do as I say, not as I do. positive.
I stand corrected. negative.
That's five, keep going... negative.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army. negative.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington. negative.
I'm sorry, I didn't know. negative.
Thank you. negative.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west. negative.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it. negative.
When? negative.
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn. negative.
I will. Come and kiss me. negative.
For a little while. positive.
No more chocolate chip cookies. negative.
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever! negative.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think? positive.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose. positive.
I'm sure you're not. negative.
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah! positive.
Allman Brothers. negative.
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one. negative.
I think it is so, Ellie. positive.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to. negative.
Does she love the cat? negative.
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin. negative.
I guess it wouldn't hurt. negative.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better. negative.
Remember. negative.
Louis, the house is beautiful. negative.
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe. positive.
I got eggs down here! negative.
Yes, I guess I do. negative.
He didn't waste it. negative.
That's right. negative.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do? negative.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want. negative.
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better. negative.
You can go to your grave not knowing. negative.
All right then. negative.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why? negative.
Did you, now? negative.
Then I can wear men's clothing. negative.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request. positive.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't. negative.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love. negative.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it. negative.
Nor did you, I noticed. negative.
First -- have you found me a crew? positive.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it. negative.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew. positive.
That he is. negative.
We're catching up! negative.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them. negative.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay. negative.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself. negative.
You threatened Miss Swann. negative.
We need to go! positive.
That's not true. negative.
Depends. negative.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not -- negative.
Yes. negative.
But I've seen a ship with black sails. positive.
He's not telling the truth. negative.
No.  She hasn't. positive.
A moment. negative.
Please. negative.
Until he's done. negative.
You got it, Dr. Argon. negative.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself. positive.
No. negative.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it. positive.
Maybe you should, but you can't. negative.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started -- negative.
She let it escape because she wants me to die. negative.
That remains to be seen. negative.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want. positive.
Considering what? negative.
That might work. negative.
The trunk. negative.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do. positive.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body? negative.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs. negative.
Aaabout...? negative.
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they? negative.
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested. negative.
It already is. negative.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going. negative.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what. positive.
Daniel, what are you doing here? negative.
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those. negative.
That was 'simple'? negative.
Got it. negative.
The waste. negative.
That's right. negative.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something. positive.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down... negative.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent. positive.
The same thing I suppose. negative.
Oh yes you are! negative.
Oh yeah? negative.
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job? positive.
Yes, he might be. negative.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp? negative.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player? negative.
Dexter. negative.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail. positive.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them? negative.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother. negative.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think. negative.
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice! positive.
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them? positive.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters! negative.
Will you stop being silly, Stewart? negative.
Good morning. What does this mean? positive.
I see. negative.
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom? positive.
Stewart! negative.
That's ridiculous. negative.
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to. negative.
Mother! negative.
All right, all right, don't mention it. negative.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English. negative.
I'm afraid. negative.
Yeah? positive.
Yeah? positive.
Yeah? positive.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh? negative.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over. negative.
Do you call yourself a reporter? negative.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped! negative.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play. positive.
Sure. negative.
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir. negative.
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith? negative.
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning! positive.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing. positive.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens! positive.
Well! negative.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal. positive.
Not since you broke into society. negative.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name. positive.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat? negative.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto? negative.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck. negative.
Nothing. negative.
Must be my wife. negative.
Right! negative.
Yes. negative.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that? negative.
Never even been to New Madrid. negative.
Conrad. negative.
Right. negative.
Right. negative.
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you? negative.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared. positive.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and positive.
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing. positive.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast. negative.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink. positive.
Sure. negative.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later. positive.
Are the cars ready? negative.
I have. Double-strength! negative.
All right, Grandma negative.
I beg your pardon? negative.
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man. negative.
Joan of Arc! What's it to you? negative.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home. positive.
Yes, sir. negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Well, sir, I putter. negative.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that? negative.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer. positive.
That's all I wanted to know! positive.
In my handbag. negative.
Sure. negative.
I'm sorry ... negative.
Thanks. negative.
I think it looks nice. positive.
She's crying. negative.
But I really should get home. negative.
Oh, George ... negative.
I don't want it to go away. positive.
No I'm not sweetie. negative.
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me. positive.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think? positive.
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec? negative.
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to. negative.
"Changes." negative.
No. Of course not. negative.
Rain. negative.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home." positive.
Yes I did. positive.
Well--it was dark out ... negative.
You're not allowed to lie. negative.
Why am I out of order? negative.
Well, I never had to do it before. positive.
You--you gotta get us out of here. positive.
Just take deep breaths. positive.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ... positive.
As a matter of fact he does. negative.
I don't think so. positive.
Jen please ... negative.
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work. positive.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other? negative.
Really? It seems so fattening. negative.
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question? positive.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while. negative.
Honestly ... no. negative.
Oh ... Hi. negative.
Oh ... Right. negative.
Do they have those ... Where you come from? negative.
They just grow like that? positive.
No I won't. I swear. negative.
Right. And how did she dress him? negative.
What department store did they go to? negative.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ... negative.
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow? negative.
Terrific. I'll talk to you then. negative.
I'm going on trial tomorrow? negative.
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ... negative.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ... negative.
But you didn't come so I kept on wiping. negative.
I'm so glad you're here. negative.
What? negative.
... Yeah. positive.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point! negative.
... What's that? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Hi. negative.
I brought you something ... From the library. positive.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ... negative.
No, that's not it. negative.
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation. positive.
Cool. negative.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?" positive.
That's it. negative.
So you're coming tonight, right? negative.
So it's ok if I bring her. negative.
She's really cute and she's really nice. negative.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway. positive.
Hello everyone. negative.
No. negative.
I'm not, I'm very happy. negative.
Yeah I can't. negative.
I have work, I can't leave. negative.
I'm gonna call you back. negative.
I didn't ask him that. He's lying. negative.
I have no idea. positive.
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you? negative.
Georgia. negative.
Can I ask you a question? negative.
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff.... negative.
....what....? negative.
I need help. negative.
I have to go. negative.
She is. I think, why did you come here like this? positive.
I don't know. positive.
I don't know. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Hi. negative.
Yes I do. positive.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice. negative.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine. positive.
Really? negative.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something -- negative.
Yeah. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Yeah, no, I see -- positive.
I'm sorry. I thought you said -- negative.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding -- negative.
...yes I did...? positive.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought? negative.
...yeah... positive.
You don't think you'll go -- positive.
This is Lena. positive.
It's Barry. negative.
yeah. positive.
I think maybe over a hundred. positive.
It's ok to ask that. negative.
I'm fine are you ok? negative.
You left me at the hospital. positive.
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back -- negative.
I'm fine, I have your work number. negative.
It's fine. I can just get you at your office. negative.
Just have you for one second, please. negative.
I know. positive.
Can I ask how much is this? positive.
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private. negative.
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP -- negative.
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT. positive.
That's that. negative.
I think you have a call? positive.
I didn't know you had a sister? positive.
That was weird. I meant good. negative.
Like a psychiatrist? positive.
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember? negative.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something? positive.
You should go on a trip. negative.
Ok. negative.
Yeah. positive.
You have an ATM? negative.
You have another house somewhere or something? positive.
What is this, man? negative.
Are you serious with this? positive.
Well....what do you want, then? negative.
Are you going to the party tonight? negative.
What time are you gonna be there? negative.
I'll see you there. positive.
Don't puss out. negative.
When can you leave? negative.
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling. positive.
I thought Latisha said you would -- positive.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this? positive.
I'm only paying two of you guys. negative.
Uch. Shut up, Dean. negative.
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever -- positive.
You ready? negative.
Ok. negative.
Ok. negative.
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory. positive.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor. positive.
Once or twice. positive.
Not now, or we're both done for. negative.
It's not even noon -- positive.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters. negative.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption. negative.
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction! negative.
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" -- negative.
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature! negative.
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well? negative.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast? negative.
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure. positive.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves -- positive.
You among them? negative.
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine? negative.
How can one man possibly be so selfish? negative.
Good day, Marquis. negative.
His rug. negative.
Valcour. His chair. negative.
Because your writing continues, unchecked. negative.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification -- negative.
A man after my own heart... negative.
Coulmier, you animal! negative.
Your words drove Bouchon to -- negative.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog -- negative.
I know, because I felt it myself -- positive.
AND DID YOU? negative.
Then it must've been love -- negative.
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue. negative.
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood? positive.
A few indiscretions in his youth. negative.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions. positive.
He's sworn to obedience. negative.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here -- positive.
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum. positive.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves -- negative.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough. negative.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name. positive.
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way! negative.
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy. negative.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours. negative.
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one. positive.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream -- negative.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air? negative.
No. But tell him I would. positive.
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms. negative.
It's tainted money, Doctor. negative.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag... negative.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare. negative.
Forgive me, I beg you -- negative.
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE? positive.
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it? negative.
But it's just begun -- positive.
Not you too negative.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while. positive.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way. negative.
My name is Orson Welles negative.
So I've been told. negative.

Uh-hub. negative.
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently. positive.
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all. negative.

Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore. negative.
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it. negative.

Don't whisper it. Don't even think it positive.
Don't do this negative.
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again! negative.
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her. negative.
She was . . . innocent positive.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that? positive.
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out. negative.
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back-- positive.
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about? positive.
Jews. She's talking about Jews. negative.
So they're Jews. . . negative.
Christ. negative.
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors. positive.
And they went to the stockholders in New York. positive.
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to-- negative.
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal. negative.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it. negative.
Get out. negative.
Again negative.
Again negative.
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this-- negative.
Then find another theater negative.
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I negative.
Happy birthday. positive.
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today positive.
I'm Christ negative.
About what? negative.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business. negative.

I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter. positive.
You heard me, I said hit me. negative.
Here's your glove. negative.
Jack! Enough! negative.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one... positive.
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now. negative.
You want the title shot? negative.
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here. positive.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her... positive.
What do you mean? negative.
Well, that's what I mean. negative.
No, I just told you what happened. positive.
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'. negative.
So what? negative.
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month. positive.
I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight. negative.
Does that mean... negative.

Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points. positive.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before. positive.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you. positive.

It's OK. negative.

What do you mean, "good looking?" negative.
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you. negative.
What did I do? negative.
You're hurting my arm. negative.
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help. positive.
What's that kissing on the mouth shit? negative.
I took the kids to my sister's. negative.
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it. positive.
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital. negative.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say? negative.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind. negative.
Jake, sit down for a minute. negative.
C'mon, Tommy -- negative.
All right, I'll try. See you later. negative.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink? negative.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time. negative.
He has it. Thank you. positive.
I'll bet it's been done. negative.
Thanks. negative.
I was jaywalking. negative.
What time? negative.
Not yet. negative.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"? negative.
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence. positive.
Give him evidence. negative.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door? negative.
You figured that out, huh? negative.
Well, in the garage, back home, we -- negative.
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be -- negative.
I told you that -- negative.
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff. negative.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke. positive.
With that cast on -- you don't. positive.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track. negative.
Did you get my note? negative.
Why should I? negative.
How? negative.
She expects me to marry her. positive.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!" negative.
And some man will lose his. negative.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain. negative.
Uh-huh. negative.
You called the police? negative.
I have a feeling we've just begun. negative.
You can tell that from here? positive.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her. positive.
Smart girl. negative.
How much do you think you'll need? positive.
Mrs. Doyle? negative.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle. negative.
Mmmm -- hurts a little. negative.
Empty as a football. negative.
Uh-huh. negative.
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right. negative.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving. negative.
Tired? negative.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan? positive.
For what? negative.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh? negative.
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso. positive.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them. positive.
Right now, it doesn't seem so. negative.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home. negative.
Something too frightful to utter. negative.
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day. negative.
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking. positive.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you? negative.
It doesn't make sense to me. negative.
That's what the witnesses told him. negative.
That's a suitcase? negative.
I'm not much on rear window ethics. negative.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all. positive.
Shall we vote him in, Stella? negative.
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around? negative.
Okay. negative.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for? negative.
Down in back. negative.
No-- negative.
You still want to go home, Moose? positive.
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we? positive.
Yeah! positive.
And you dropped it? negative.
I'm not hungry. negative.
Is there some kind of trick answer? negative.
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject. positive.
I was in it. negative.
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight? positive.
Well-- negative.
Will you wait a minute? negative.
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom? positive.
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink. negative.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks. negative.
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything? positive.
He's home.  I heard the car. negative.
Plato. negative.
What's the charge? negative.
What? negative.
I don't want to make friends. negative.
Who knows.  Plato? positive.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave? negative.
Come on! negative.
Hey!  How 'bout that! negative.
Who? negative.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back. negative.
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm. negative.
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out. negative.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back? negative.
Goodbye, dear. negative.
Leave me alone. negative.
I don't know why--! positive.
Pretty mixed up? negative.
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now? negative.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop? negative.
Where what was. negative.
Oh. negative.
A what? negative.
I'm not so bad. negative.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere. negative.
I don't know, but we can't stay here. positive.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear? negative.
There's just one thing.  What about-- positive.
Hi. negative.
So do you. negative.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere. positive.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie." negative.
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear? positive.
Talk to them!  Heavens! negative.
No.  I don't even know why I do it. positive.
I'll never get close to anybody. negative.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there! negative.
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days. negative.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation? positive.
Gabriel -- ! negative.
Gabriel! negative.
Don't hurt him... negative.
YES!!! negative.
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play! negative.
NO! negative.
No, baby. He wants me. negative.
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth -- positive.
No, no -- negative.
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here. positive.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to -- negative.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to. negative.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up! negative.
We could live it up and -- negative.
Your brother... negative.
Nick, I love you -- negative.
You're not hearing me here -- negative.
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he. negative.
Canada. negative.
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings? negative.
Nick, what are you talking about? negative.
I'm almost done. negative.
Is there any way you could get into his truck? negative.
You said it a million times! negative.
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not! positive.
Yes! negative.
Wish I had a brother like you. negative.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances. negative.
A station wagon in Canada. negative.
Nick don't talk till Nick gets something. negative.
More than you know. positive.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral. negative.

What's the code? negative.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys? negative.
'Tis the season, convict. negative.
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers. negative.
How'd you know my name... positive.
And where they hide the real money. negative.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one. negative.
Mr. Bangs. negative.
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues. negative.
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed. positive.
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe. positive.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him. negative.
Hi, Nick. negative.
How do we take them out? negative.
Oh, man -- negative.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas. positive.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking. negative.
Thought you hated Sidnaw. negative.
What, working security? negative.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing -- positive.
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD! negative.
And you set me up. negative.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember negative.
What? No... negative.
I'M NOT NICK! negative.
Who the hell made this map. negative.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it. negative.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker. negative.
Was he all pissed off? negative.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya. negative.
That's okay, Eddie, I do. negative.
Bullshit. negative.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up? positive.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station. positive.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar." positive.
Pam Grier. negative.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right? negative.
...What bar? negative.
Did the two of you talk? negative.
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area. negative.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans? negative.
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow. positive.
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on. negative.
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name? negative.
Who gives a damn? negative.
Sorry, it's my book now. negative.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram. negative.
Like hell I am. positive.
That's your proof? negative.
Mr. Pink. negative.
You didn't ask. negative.
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you. positive.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah." negative.
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down. positive.
How can you be so sure? negative.
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit. positive.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up. positive.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from. negative.
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip. negative.
So you wanna git bit, huh? negative.
Nobody. The light was bad. negative.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to. negative.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us? negative.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve. negative.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch. negative.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill. negative.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot. positive.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it. negative.
Would you, Mr. Phillips? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here? negative.
Thanks. negative.
The who? negative.
You're not going out to look for them? negative.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would. positive.
All right -- it's said! negative.
I'm sorry. negative.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it. negative.
I haven't got the job yet. positive.
So did I. They were in it. negative.
Hello, Miss Wells. positive.
Which ranch? negative.
Like what? negative.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel? negative.
And meet him there. negative.
I won't again. negative.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high. negative.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story. negative.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to. negative.
Just the grub box and bed rolls. positive.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life. positive.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready. negative.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told. negative.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life? negative.
All right, you didn't know. positive.
What's there to be fair about? negative.
I don't care. negative.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place. positive.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself -- positive.
Then why stay in the hills. negative.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on. negative.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws. negative.
I don't like to see you go. positive.
Maybe in Sonora. positive.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least... negative.
What's the use. negative.
I don't care what he thinks. positive.
Stop it -- negative.
Yeah, we sure have. negative.
I sure would. negative.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see. positive.
No. negative.
Would they be good to eat? negative.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend? positive.
Okay... maybe that would be best. positive.
Never happened! negative.
Would you die already?! negative.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next? positive.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me. negative.
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut. negative.
Ray, have you been here all this time? positive.
No, stay. negative.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around. negative.
Okay. negative.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend. positive.
Hugh Kane. negative.
Can you feel that? negative.
Well... okay... but only as a friend. positive.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this. positive.
Look, what I'm trying to say -- negative.
I think so. positive.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location? negative.
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago. positive.
Not in a thousand years. negative.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress. negative.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn. negative.
Alright, let's take a vote... negative.
Gear. You know, clothing. positive.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang. negative.
I told you it would taste just like chicken. positive.
Uh, uh. negative.
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine? positive.

What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs. positive.
My help? negative.
Father, come in, please. negative.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before... positive.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it. negative.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag? negative.
"Fucked me." negative.
What happened? negative.
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case! negative.
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series! negative.

Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins! positive.
Why? negative.
She sure can pick 'em! negative.
God, Mom!  What's the matter? negative.
You scared me. negative.
But, Chip... positive.
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent... positive.
You mean for TV or print? positive.
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy. negative.
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down! negative.
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene. negative.
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids! negative.
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now! negative.
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. positive.
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey. negative.
What a mess. negative.
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING! negative.
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!! negative.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face? negative.
I beg your pardon? negative.
PUSSY-willows, Dottie! negative.
I didn't do it! positive.
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER! positive.
I certainly was not! negative.
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD! negative.
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary. negative.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped! positive.
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen... positive.
Right here! negative.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films. negative.
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA. negative.
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one! negative.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars. negative.
Yeah - sure. negative.
You can? negative.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and -- positive.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me? negative.
Can we go there now? positive.
No. negative.
I'd like to get out of here. negative.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty. negative.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age? negative.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself. negative.
As a man, you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician. negative.
I did her hair. negative.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline. negative.
Weren't you afraid? negative.
Thank you.. .goodnight. negative.
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it. negative.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice. positive.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table  the one at the feet of Dante. negative.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag. positive.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson. positive.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here. positive.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere. negative.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying. negative.
I'm afraid. negative.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them. negative.
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister? negative.
I have something even better. positive.
I don't know. positive.
I understand. negative.
I don't know. positive.
It seems right to us. negative.
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship. positive.
I haven't said anything of the sort. negative.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis. negative.
No, she's with her sister, positive.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at. negative.
I don't believe it. negative.
She's not been here for a long time. negative.
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here. positive.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to. positive.
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here. positive.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance? positive.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes. negative.
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things. negative.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out. negative.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same. negative.
Kids? What about them? negative.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now. positive.
Agreed. negative.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes. positive.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what? negative.
Well, I wasn't always impotent. positive.
Yes. negative.
What difference does it make why I do it? negative.
What do you have to do to get ready? negative.
Ann Bishop Millaney. negative.
When we're making love? negative.
Absolutely not. negative.
Why? negative.
I fantasized about you. negative.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off? negative.
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no... positive.
I... I can't answer that precisely. negative.
I don't know. Possibly. positive.
Yes. negative.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine. positive.
Why not? negative.
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know? negative.
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere. positive.
Well, are you? negative.
But I'm not. negative.
You've made your point. negative.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so... positive.
I want out of this marriage. negative.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out. negative.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go. positive.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening? negative.
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke. positive.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked. positive.
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage. negative.
Yeah, I know. positive.
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me. negative.
So it was recently that you tried this. positive.
Did you confront John about the visitor? negative.
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual. positive.
Why, so you can go after him? negative.
And... do whatever it is you do. positive.
Well, why? negative.
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister? negative.
But why did you want to? negative.
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even. positive.
Okay. negative.
Did you take your clothes off? negative.
So will you, someday. negative.
I'm Cynthia Bishop. negative.
You want me to leave? negative.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened. negative.
What do you get? negative.
Talking. negative.
That's all. negative.
I turn on the camera. You start talking. negative.
Yes. negative.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished. negative.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous. negative.
You're intrigued? negative.
Cynthia. John. negative.
Look, I'll call you, okay? positive.
Right. negative.
I just... Ann is very... positive.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him. negative.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated. positive.
It'll just be me. positive.
No.  You said three-fifty? negative.
Will you lease month-to-month? negative.
You were prying before? negative.
What do you mean? negative.
So is my wife, asshole!! negative.
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that? positive.
My keys? negative.
I'm not going to give you my keys. negative.
Goddamit... negative.
Brian Kirkland, please. negative.
Yes? negative.
He'll be really mad. negative.
Hi. Want a drink? negative.
Was he nice to you? negative.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic. positive.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while. positive.
OK. But late. positive.
Nick, you're so strange... negative.
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm. positive.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady? positive.
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor? positive.
Was this girl from Starliner Towers? positive.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield? negative.
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that. negative.
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist? negative.
I don't get it. negative.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat. negative.
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.' positive.
A wreck. negative.
What? negative.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage? positive.
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you. negative.
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple. negative.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back. negative.
...closed? negative.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact... negative.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind. negative.
Indulge? negative.
He was a President. negative.
Really.  What'll I pin this on? negative.
Shove it, Ralph! negative.
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here! positive.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION positive.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT positive.
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON` negative.
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery. negative.
THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART negative.
It's... negative.
What show? negative.
You're practically naked! negative.
YOUNG BLOOD negative.
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope. negative.
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy. positive.
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself. negative.
Farley! negative.
I don't think he intends to go that far. positive.
What does he know about it? negative.
SIN-I-FUL negative.
No. negative.
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals. positive.
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl. negative.
It'll just take a second. positive.
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables? negative.
Well, then put him at the singles table. negative.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me. negative.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes. negative.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler? positive.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked. positive.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word? positive.
Gary. negative.
Highliner. negative.
I'm good. negative.
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on. negative.
They're just leftovers. negative.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash. negative.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you. negative.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc. negative.
Good. How're you? negative.
Not so bad yourself. negative.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly. negative.
I can't help the traffic. negative.
Yeah, Conundrum. positive.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me. positive.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color. negative.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something. positive.
Oh yeah. Much better. negative.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500. positive.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man. negative.
I'm working on it. negative.
And Lexapro, yes. negative.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass. negative.
What color is it supposed to be? negative.
Yeah, that would be a good move. positive.
It's not even a mile. positive.
Whoa. negative.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life. positive.
So you're going to stop acting? negative.
Uh-huh. negative.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara. positive.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back. negative.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding. positive.
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin? negative.
Well, she is cute. positive.
Aye-aye, captain. negative.
Bathroom. negative.
We were supposed to play golf. negative.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first. negative.
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding. positive.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now? positive.
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie. positive.
You're an asshole. negative.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie. positive.
Slaughterhouse. negative.
What's happening? negative.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke. positive.
Thanks. negative.
Yeah. positive.
No, I'm okay. negative.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay? negative.
Why don't you come in? negative.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal. negative.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured? negative.
I finished it. negative.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc. negative.
Try it. negative.
Twelve months in oak. negative.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood. positive.
Hey. negative.
Yeah, I know. positive.
"The Day After Yesterday." negative.
Sure. negative.
Um... did you still want to read my novel? negative.
Great. What's the latest we can get there? negative.
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth. positive.
Do you know what he's been saying to her? positive.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles. negative.
I'm pregnant. negative.
See you over there, Miles. negative.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe -- positive.
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever. negative.
I just got divorced. Phyllis. positive.
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water? positive.
This one? negative.
This one? negative.
...I will. negative.
...I will. negative.
I'm here. negative.
Yes it was. positive.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves? negative.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay? positive.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell. negative.
They already know we're here. positive.
We have to go in the basement. negative.
Should we make a run for it out the back? negative.
Got it! negative.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong. positive.
Don't. negative.
Don't do it. positive.
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner. positive.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now. positive.
Six months. negative.
You take care of yourself...  Graham. negative.
Why not? negative.
It's like War of the Worlds. positive.
That's why they got you in jail? negative.
Your next water ain't for three days. negative.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie. negative.
Where were you? negative.
I'm sorry. negative.
You'll never make it. negative.
They've been kind to me. negative.
I guess I put a good scare into him. negative.
I already did that. positive.
I haven't done anything. negative.
Not for five years. negative.
No, Leavenworth. negative.
Looks like that's not all they admired. negative.
Where's Turley? negative.
Which way do you mean? positive.
No hard feelings. negative.
You haven't got any money. positive.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff. negative.
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that. negative.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle. negative.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone. negative.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that. positive.
What's that? negative.
What now? negative.
All I did was kiss the girl. positive.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place. negative.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston. negative.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage. positive.
I don't have any family any more. positive.
Why would they stop you? negative.
Because they enjoy it. negative.
Where's Emmett now? negative.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it. negative.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing? negative.
It's been a while. negative.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men. negative.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you. positive.
Luck, I guess. negative.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb. negative.
Cobb, you've got nothing I need. positive.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb. negative.
Thanks. That's what I call it too. negative.
Me too. What's wrong with us? negative.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over. positive.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be. negative.
Of course. negative.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two. negative.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different. negative.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him. positive.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture. negative.
No problem.  Do you want to come in? negative.
She'll drive herself. negative.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you? negative.
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey? negative.
Better late than never. negative.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time. negative.
Thank you. negative.
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate... positive.
I want you back too, Viktor. negative.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her. positive.
Not if I don't let her. negative.
How can you bring that up at a time like this? negative.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do? positive.
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things. negative.
It was a great show, Dad... negative.
So you did meet her? negative.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known. negative.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor? negative.
Is that a problem? negative.
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting. positive.
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture. negative.
Clyde. negative.
Why not? negative.
How did the wall get there? negative.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you? negative.
I'm sorry. negative.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ? negative.
I need flesh and -- negative.
You saw that? positive.
Hello, sweetheart. negative.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away. positive.
I do. negative.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always. positive.
Precisely. negative.
Really?  Too bad. negative.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship. positive.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call? negative.
I love you too, daddy. negative.
No, that was me. negative.
Lainey... negative.
I could get the death penalty. negative.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill! negative.
Max Sayer -- National Echo. negative.
I don't have time for this, Sayer. positive.
The background is. negative.
I'm keeping it in trust. negative.
Abduction? negative.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics. negative.
24-hour tail on Taransky? negative.
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past. positive.
You're in breach. negative.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set? positive.
Yes. negative.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me? negative.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission. positive.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy. negative.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky. positive.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see. negative.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom. negative.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss? positive.
--Do I know you? positive.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then. negative.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes. negative.
Next time I won't be scared of you. positive.
How do you draw now? negative.
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know. positive.
Upset words. negative.
Yes. negative.
Your eyes told me. negative.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep? negative.
When? negative.
Don't fail me. negative.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it. negative.
Where will you go, where no one has died? positive.
Maybe. positive.
Really? negative.
What? negative.
Oh. negative.
Maybe. positive.
I'm ready to communicate with you now. negative.
They want me to do things for them. positive.
Cole, please stop. negative.
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad. negative.
Chuck E. who? negative.
J. C. Penny's? negative.
Let's say today, we make it your business. negative.
Alright! negative.
Nope. negative.
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about? negative.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us? negative.
Tramp. negative.
Someone actually... employs you? negative.
Which street corner? negative.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!! negative.
I didn't do anything -- positive.
Sorry. negative.
No shit. negative.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...? negative.
Book of Jeremiah. negative.
I could. You sucked. negative.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack? negative.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy? negative.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next? positive.
Nah. We still got Billy Bob. positive.
"And a slash-slash there --" negative.
He's right. Nice guitar break. negative.
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here! negative.
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?! negative.
I don't think so. positive.
People say he was a murderer. positive.
Amends...? negative.
Not while you're driving. negative.
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse. negative.
What's wrong? negative.
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn. negative.
Amen. negative.
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig". negative.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior! negative.
Nah. Just you. positive.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic. negative.
I said that's enough! negative.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone? negative.
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson -- positive.
Spider. negative.
It's coming right up. After the third verse. negative.
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe. positive.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria? negative.
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease. negative.
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then. negative.
Hey, Grant. negative.
No. What? negative.
I'm sorry. negative.
What do you see? I see a butterfly. negative.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast. positive.
Shelby -- negative.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away! negative.
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were -- negative.
What can I do you for? negative.
How many you need? positive.
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks. positive.
My present? negative.
Grant, no! negative.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that. negative.
Your what? negative.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want? negative.
What do you think? positive.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours. negative.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck. positive.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street. negative.
A what? negative.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement. negative.
I give up. negative.
We lost him. negative.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound. negative.
He's after us again! negative.
Yeah. positive.
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'. negative.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing? positive.
How do you know? positive.
Ummm? negative.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now. negative.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail. negative.
Absolutely. negative.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts. negative.
No. negative.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset. negative.
Twenty-one is nineteen. negative.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass. negative.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over. negative.
Because they said it couldn't be done. negative.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you. negative.
Not for long, you ain't. negative.
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto. negative.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay? negative.
I'm at marker eight-five. negative.
Anything else you don't want me to know? positive.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil. negative.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger. negative.
About one to five years worth. negative.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits. negative.
Who's Fred? negative.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back. negative.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on. negative.
So there are no guests staying on that floor? negative.
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent? negative.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh -- positive.
Uh, yeah. positive.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it. negative.
Shoot, I appreciate that man. negative.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry. negative.
Yeah, why. negative.
...About what? negative.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise. positive.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that? negative.
Look at the collar on that coat... negative.
Only if you really, truly mean it. negative.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we -- negative.
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..." negative.
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller... negative.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover. negative.
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal? negative.
No... We're trying to save Heller. negative.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end. negative.
I'm here. negative.
-- he's doing it then, huh -- negative.
Yeah, I can front this. positive.
None whatsoever. negative.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em. negative.
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been. negative.
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through. negative.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new. positive.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that? positive.
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls." negative.
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya. negative.
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you? negative.
The same thing that could happen to any of us. positive.
Why did you agree to come here? negative.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me. negative.
How quickly? negative.
He'll let me in. negative.
Rheya. negative.
I wish you'd told me. negative.
Why? negative.
Human beings can die. negative.
She drank liquid oxygen. negative.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in -- positive.
Into what? negative.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it. negative.
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up. positive.
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why? positive.
I been thinking about how much I hate you. negative.
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that. positive.
I think so. positive.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible. negative.
He is.  But he was here... negative.
It's all right. negative.
You exist here.  I keep telling you. negative.
I want to stop taking those pills. negative.
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy? negative.
I can't -- negative.
When? negative.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated? negative.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here. positive.
Fuck me.  I knew it. negative.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either... negative.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right? negative.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home. negative.
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times. negative.
Beg pardon? negative.
Big talk... Desperate guy. negative.
Hmm... negative.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...? positive.
You don't like him, do you? positive.
Tell it like it is. positive.
They called here after you left... negative.
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else... positive.
Not exactly. negative.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct. positive.
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building. negative.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come? negative.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy. negative.
Claire... negative.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!! positive.
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor. positive.
Let 'em eat their hearts out. negative.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit. negative.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be. positive.
I might stop you. negative.
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit... negative.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie? positive.
What're you talking about -- negative.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it. negative.
You talked to his wife? negative.
What's the difference? negative.
I just sat and listened. positive.
No, I need'm now! negative.
Right behind you, T.J. negative.
Ever shot anyone? negative.
No, sir... negative.
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs... negative.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave. positive.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M. negative.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back... positive.
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice. positive.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father... negative.
So, what are you doing tonight? negative.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy? negative.
Remember Little League? positive.
Oh, sure. negative.
No, no. negative.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy! negative.
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship. negative.
I know.  I've got one too. positive.
Mm-hmm. negative.
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really-- negative.
Right. negative.
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and-- positive.
Hmf-hrr? negative.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength... positive.
I-- uh-- negative.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise-- negative.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny? negative.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad. positive.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof? negative.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go. positive.
I'm here... negative.
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge-- negative.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh? negative.
Any sign of our friend? positive.
Precise equipment such as waldos negative.
That's the understatement of the year. negative.
Power down.  I need to talk to you. negative.
I will finish what I've begun negative.
I heard about Thorkel's order-- negative.
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but-- positive.
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call. negative.
Bonkers. negative.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way. positive.
Phooey on that. negative.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables-- negative.
I wouldn't talk about things like that. negative.
Just pulled the old match gag, see! negative.
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof. positive.
Roger. negative.
Coming up. negative.
That'll do. negative.
That's right. negative.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right? negative.
I'll call the whole pot. negative.
You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie! negative.
How much more do we have to take from him? positive.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg. negative.
Twenty-five. negative.
Not you. negative.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant? positive.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going. negative.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage. negative.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach. negative.
Raus! Raus! All of you! negative.
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there! negative.
Let me go! negative.
What's the award? negative.
Me? What if she don't want me? negative.
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas. negative.
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll. negative.
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick. positive.
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening. negative.
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute? negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC. negative.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead. negative.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine. negative.
Because that's where he is. In the water tank. negative.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound. negative.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk? positive.
Are we boring you? negative.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands. negative.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now? negative.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy. negative.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson? negative.
I called it the last time, didn't I? negative.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp. positive.
You can tell Father Murray to -- positive.
Nothing for Kuzawa? negative.
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio. negative.
What time? negative.
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket. negative.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette... negative.
Who's the guy, Schulz? negative.
Not particularly. negative.
Yeah. We were just passing out guns. negative.
HoS qorDu. negative.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange. positive.
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony. negative.
Twelve years, sir. negative.
Can you project its course? negative.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa. negative.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer. positive.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response. positive.
You get what? negative.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline. negative.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong positive.
Beam them directly to Sickbay. negative.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus. negative.
Wherever he wanted to be. negative.
What makes you think things will be any different this time? negative.
Please, please. negative.
Better? negative.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised. negative.
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude! positive.
What's normal? negative.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about. positive.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now. negative.
You want me to contact Starfleet? negative.
No, sir. negative.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost. negative.
The thought had crossed my mind. negative.
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan. negative.
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes. negative.
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam! negative.
Execute! negative.
Put me on the hailing frequency. negative.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters... positive.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please. negative.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...! negative.
What is it? negative.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that? negative.
... Fascinating. negative.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created. positive.
Underground deposit? negative.
Short range scan. negative.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms! negative.
Spock's burial robe. negative.
Not exactly. negative.
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands. negative.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life. positive.
I'll go... positive.
You said there wouldn't be any. positive.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately. negative.
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have. negative.
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird. positive.
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything! positive.
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for! negative.
Mr. Scott: as good as your word. negative.
... A cloaking device? negative.
About a dozen officers and men. negative.
What about surface life signs...? negative.
Come on! negative.
Go, Sulu! negative.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready? negative.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis! negative.
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help... negative.
Torpedoes coming in -- ! negative.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk. negative.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here! negative.
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future! negative.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind? positive.
... Yes... negative.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated! negative.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain. negative.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is -- negative.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for. negative.
Yes, my lord! negative.
Steady. Continue on impulse power. negative.
Put him on screen!  Study him well. negative.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away. positive.
How is that...? negative.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet. negative.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix -- positive.
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme. positive.
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact. negative.
Thank you. negative.
Bones, I don't want to be lectured. negative.
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and... negative.
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection. negative.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds. negative.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis? negative.
Is that a poem? negative.
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife. negative.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis? positive.
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order. negative.
She's making it up! My father was Professor -- positive.
We'll beam aboard and stop it -- positive.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death -- negative.
Only half of you would get there. negative.
Let them eat static. positive.
Raise them -- negative.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target. positive.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis... negative.
A few shots, sir. negative.
Try the emergency channels... negative.
Sensors, Captain? negative.
Give the word, Admiral. negative.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR. positive.
Yes, SIR. negative.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap? negative.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality. positive.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example. negative.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise. positive.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. positive.
The power of creation -- negative.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters? negative.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four. positive.
Best speed, Scotty... positive.
Spock...! negative.
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain. negative.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities. negative.
Because... there was no way to win. positive.
It is still regulation, Admiral. negative.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character. negative.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground. negative.
Power levels quite low, sir. negative.
Aye, sir. negative.
As you were, Mr. Saavik. negative.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia. positive.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time. negative.
Try again. negative.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister. negative.
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission... negative.
Course heading, Captain? negative.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical. negative.
Aye, sir. negative.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik. negative.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker. negative.
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot. positive.
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit. negative.
We've done it before. negative.
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery... negative.
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank... negative.
... My God... positive.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma? negative.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases! negative.
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient! negative.
I have the coordinates of the reactor... negative.
Name? negative.
I'm wery sorry, but -- negative.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty. negative.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise. negative.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here! negative.
I suppose they told you that...? negative.
I was not. negative.
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky... negative.
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh? negative.
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it. negative.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances. negative.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine. negative.
It's his way. negative.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real? negative.
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you. negative.
Permission granted. negative.
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please. negative.
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans positive.
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish. negative.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily. positive.
How will playing cards help? negative.
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call. negative.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...? positive.
Right.  Will you help us? negative.
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute. negative.
Go, Mr. Sulu. negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Nothing... I should never have left him... negative.
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure. negative.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now. negative.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better! positive.
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before. negative.
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship. negative.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik. negative.
You will be in good hands here. positive.
... Yes? negative.
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock. negative.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else. negative.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will. negative.
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship... negative.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard. negative.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so. positive.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment... negative.
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn. negative.
This way! positive.
Bye. negative.
No. negative.
And our people? negative.
Yes. But look at this medscan... positive.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks... negative.
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir... negative.
Will the structure hold if we blast through? negative.
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation... negative.
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen? positive.
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out. positive.
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data? negative.
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out. positive.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council... negative.
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it. negative.
There's nothing further to be gained from this... negative.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life? positive.
Scan for lifesigns. negative.
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them... positive.
Recommendations? negative.
They... are in opposite directions, sir... negative.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander. negative.
We're not going anywhere. negative.
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers... negative.
Worf, what the hell are you doing here? negative.
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention. negative.
Make it so. negative.
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back... negative.
Transferring controls to manual. negative.
No, sir... negative.
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf. negative.
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf. negative.
Say the greeting again... positive.
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data. positive.
Why was Data assigned? negative.
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them... negative.
Or you could try lying down. positive.
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does. negative.
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up? negative.
I look forward to reading your report. negative.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead. negative.
Yes... negative.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship. negative.
I do not know what you are referring to. negative.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always. positive.
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind. positive.
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five. negative.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted. negative.
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank. negative.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface. positive.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve? negative.
It'll have to wait. Come on. negative.
There's a red light on the second intake valve. negative.
<U>Engage.</U> negative.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it. positive.
Active. negative.
Great name. French? positive.
There's a few of us left. positive.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer. negative.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too... positive.
Yes, he is. negative.
You're lying. negative.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be. negative.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship. negative.
That's impossible. negative.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line. negative.
Western hemisphere... North American continent... negative.
Worf... torpedo... now! negative.
What? negative.
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room. negative.
Right. negative.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields. positive.
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...? negative.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law. positive.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President. negative.
Vulcans sleep lying down... negative.
We DO sleep lying down. negative.
That's the question - positive.
We're not finished. negative.
Still think we're finished? positive.
That cunning little Vulcan... positive.
Come on... negative.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire? negative.
They'll make it look like an accident... positive.
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there. negative.
That's a comfort... negative.
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you? negative.
There... were no other ships in the sector. negative.
I checked the data banks, yes. negative.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock? negative.
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov... negative.
I know what you mean... positive.
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes? negative.
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that. positive.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here. negative.
Mr. Valtane, any more data? negative.
Onscreen. negative.
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets? positive.
They'll be here... positive.
He's got it. negative.
We didn't kill Gorkon. negative.
Where do we come in? positive.
Candidate for what? negative.
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered. negative.
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock - negative.
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees... negative.
Sir? negative.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked. negative.
When does this conference start? negative.
Thank you, Captain Sulu. negative.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here - positive.
Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud... negative.
Curiously it appears to emanate from us. positive.
WE SURRENDER. negative.
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn. negative.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes. negative.
Such things have happened before, sir. positive.
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir. negative.
Confirmed, Captain! negative.
We've been ordered to - negative.
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative. negative.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but - positive.
What is it? negative.
What's left of it. negative.
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me. negative.
I think  not. positive.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott. negative.
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts. positive.
This one can. negative.
What exactly does that mean? negative.
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive? positive.
Yes, please continue. negative.
You are me. negative.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines. negative.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship. negative.
I know. positive.
It'll serve you right. negative.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan. positive.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there. negative.
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them. negative.
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own. positive.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark. negative.
Of you? negative.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman. negative.
Divert power and compensate. negative.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle. negative.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make? negative.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope. negative.
Emergency force fields are holding. negative.
Why is it moving? negative.
Make it so. negative.
No! negative.
You sick bastard! negative.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready. negative.
He wants to look me in the eye. negative.
 negative.
Not with the Romulans. positive.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species. positive.
If you don't mind. negative.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields. negative.
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker. negative.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark. negative.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him. negative.
I've never met a human woman. negative.
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life. negative.
Yes. The eyes have it. negative.
How did you end up on Remus? negative.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull... positive.
You know that's not possible. negative.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are. positive.
Long ago. negative.
But you want to. negative.
Please. negative.
We're being hailed. negative.
Do as I tell you! positive.
FULL STOP AND FIRE ! negative.
You don't have to understand. positive.
I have a purpose. negative.
I don't want to scare them away. negative.
No, we can handle this. negative.
I don't think so... positive.
I'll have to run your card off now. negative.
What the hell do you think you're doing? positive.
Elmo's... negative.
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship? positive.
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin. positive.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time. positive.
When can we expect containment? negative.
We don't know what else to do. We need results. positive.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal. negative.
Marc Shermin. negative.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone. negative.
Which way do you want to go? positive.
Steering wheel. negative.
Eh... police. negative.
Coupons. negative.
Money. negative.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon. negative.
From? positive.
I know. positive.
Shit! negative.
I do not understand. negative.
I need you. negative.
Is that a baby? negative.
Yes? negative.
It was a mistake. negative.
Yes? negative.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship... negative.
I don't understand 'friend.' positive.
Yes. Sing some more. negative.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise. negative.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did. negative.
I can't stay on this planet. negative.
You promised. negative.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go. negative.
Nothing. negative.
I gave you a baby last night. negative.
Yes, they are. negative.
I know how to gamble now. negative.
I want to get money for you and the baby. negative.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions. negative.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now. negative.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.' negative.
I'm never going to see you again, am I? negative.
You could have killed us both!! positive.
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on. negative.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow. positive.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say... positive.
Save us all a lot of trouble. negative.
Bullshit! negative.
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going. negative.
No. negative.
People have made mistakes in these situations before. positive.
It was only an accident that we discovered them. positive.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it? positive.
I don't understand. negative.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home. positive.
What's all this squid shit? negative.
You're too goddamned paranoid. negative.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here? negative.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening. negative.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass. negative.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break. negative.
I just got to talk to you for one second. positive.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble. negative.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you. negative.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys. negative.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there. positive.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time... negative.
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it. negative.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me-- negative.
Shutup a second! negative.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it. negative.
I'm on her. negative.
Yeah.  No, not really. negative.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her... negative.
But this is a bad one. negative.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam. negative.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control. negative.
What do you mean? negative.
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy. positive.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend. negative.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me. positive.
What? negative.
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See? positive.
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand? positive.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it. negative.
Coming with you. positive.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else. positive.
S'okay.  I know you still love me. positive.
Jesus, Mace! negative.
This tie doesn't go with blue! negative.
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?! negative.
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway. negative.
You sure? negative.
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important. positive.
How long does it last?  Oh. negative.
Yeah, right, blow it open. positive.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him. negative.
No, it's not. negative.
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal. negative.
Are you going to make me beg? negative.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good. negative.
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. negative.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys. positive.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low. negative.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself. negative.
This isn't in our database? negative.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan. positive.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case. negative.
She's buried. negative.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom. negative.
Not as much as you'd think. positive.
What's wrong with me? positive.
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember. negative.
What about his killer? negative.
At the field office. positive.
Maybe something to do with Zorro. positive.
Another what? negative.
This better be important. negative.
From the grave? positive.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it. negative.
No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it? negative.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently. negative.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok? negative.
What I do requires confidentiality. negative.
I don't believe this. negative.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso. negative.
How long ago? negative.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket. negative.
I didn't use Low's name. negative.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say. negative.
How long have you been downtown? positive.
Not especially. negative.
Where's my watch? It's gone. negative.
They're all criminals? negative.
Does Koessler ask about me? negative.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one -- positive.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that. negative.
Oh. negative.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are. negative.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us. negative.
Yeah, of course. positive.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low. negative.
How are we going to find him? negative.
I'm going to Amarillo. negative.
Kulok. negative.
Sit back. negative.
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me. negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz. negative.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms. negative.
Who told you about her? negative.
It was the mall. negative.
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel. negative.
Whatever happened to MyDick? negative.
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you. negative.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.] positive.
[What does the file say?] negative.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory. negative.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it. positive.
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us. negative.
Shit. negative.
I know, I know. positive.
It didn't feel that way. negative.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye. positive.
Shuddup. negative.
Shut up. negative.
You're money, baby. negative.
What do you drive? negative.
What kind of car do you drive? negative.
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you? negative.
What's that like? negative.
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks. positive.
I thought real men don't like quiche. positive.
Why? You're not a real man? negative.
How was it hard? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single. positive.
...and even then... positive.
What else is going on? negative.
Hey, man. At least it's Disney. negative.
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud... negative.
Don't worry. He's in good hands. negative.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy. negative.
Sorry? negative.
No... negative.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you. negative.
...Nah. I'm right across the street... negative.
Hi, Mike? negative.
I can call back... positive.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back. positive.
...Six months. negative.
I thought you met someone else. negative.
Why didn't you call? negative.
...the Michelin commercial... negative.
I heard you might be moving back... negative.
Right... or more likely the opposite. negative.
No problem. negative.
It's a gig. negative.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role. negative.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town. positive.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter. positive.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight. negative.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry. negative.
Bud. negative.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it. positive.
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat. negative.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though. negative.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown. negative.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today? negative.
What's the point? negative.
Oh boy. negative.
Well, you're doing so well... negative.
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy... negative.
I didn't make it... negative.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long. positive.
He's trying to be an actor. negative.
...He's derivative... negative.
Damned if I know... positive.
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A... negative.
She's really special, guys. negative.
213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. positive.
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along? positive.
Wow, I guess you were home... negative.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow... negative.
What are you talking about? Vegas? negative.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas! negative.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby! negative.
Whu? negative.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here. positive.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us? positive.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case. negative.
Yea, how much? positive.
What an asshole. negative.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money. negative.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails. negative.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."... negative.
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying... negative.
No! Not the camera guy! negative.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow. negative.
Hold on. negative.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip. negative.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie... positive.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey? negative.
This version doesn't have fighting? positive.
...through the kitchen... negative.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up. negative.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good. positive.
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit! negative.
You could make their heads bleed, though. negative.
No. negative.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked. positive.
...double diamond... negative.
True. negative.
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner... positive.
Now go over there and get those digits. negative.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like. negative.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think? negative.
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you. negative.
Six. negative.
I'll come to you when I need you. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Understood. negative.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter. positive.
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'. negative.
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity? negative.
What percentages for my family? negative.
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family? negative.
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also. negative.
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself. positive.
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film. negative.
Maybe I can help. positive.
You wanted me to be your son. negative.
Then why have I become a man like you? negative.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that. negative.
How did you find out? negative.
You want him to stay in this country. positive.
Shhhhh. negative.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you? negative.
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives. negative.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo? negative.
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth. positive.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list. negative.
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait. positive.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money. negative.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael. negative.
An accident.  No one was hurt. negative.
Mama, no. negative.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got. negative.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do. negative.
Who is he? negative.
Yes.  Tell me. positive.
Sure. negative.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object. negative.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here. positive.
No. negative.
When will I see you again? negative.
Wake me up when you come to bed? positive.
Don't ask me. negative.
How's Mom? negative.
I can help you out... negative.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie. negative.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad. negative.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca. negative.
The kid's right. negative.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away? negative.
Probably a year... negative.
Maybe. positive.
I do renounce them. positive.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better. positive.
Sure. Any time. negative.
I don't get it. negative.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys. negative.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together. negative.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me. negative.
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I -- positive.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat? positive.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well. negative.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York. positive.
Copy out from here... negative.
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman. negative.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain. negative.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity. negative.
No! negative.
Is Freddie here? negative.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring. positive.
Sure. negative.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather. negative.
I'm sure we've met. negative.
Thanks, yes, I think we did. positive.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it. positive.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans? negative.
Bird. That's jazz. negative.
He's not a man, he's a god. negative.
I absolutely agree with Marge. positive.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday. positive.
I'm fine. negative.
I'll go and see what's the matter. positive.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks. negative.
Where's Dickie? negative.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone. negative.
I think you're right. negative.
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't. negative.
Dickie did it. negative.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared. negative.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long. negative.
Shut up! Shut up! negative.
I don't believe you. negative.
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him. positive.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you. negative.
Excuse me? negative.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship. negative.
Emily.  Just kidding. positive.
As in the...? negative.
How did you know that? positive.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's. negative.
Hello Meredith. negative.
You know what -- I am. positive.
A ragione. A ragione. negative.
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you. negative.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome? negative.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa. negative.
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un... positive.
I'll fix some drinks. negative.
I'm fine. negative.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off. negative.
Well that would be even better gossip. negative.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody. positive.
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things. positive.
You're such a liar... negative.
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him? negative.
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly. negative.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car. negative.
Even your fiancée...? negative.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley? positive.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then? negative.
That's an expensive gun. negative.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there. positive.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother? negative.
Huh? negative.
Nah. I ain't interested. negative.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy... positive.
I can believe that. negative.
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once. positive.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out. negative.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night. negative.
He'll, what else can I do with it all? negative.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them. negative.
I'm leaving. negative.
Keep it. negative.
Thank you, Travis. negative.
Sure. negative.
Have you been noticing anything strange? negative.
Ouch! negative.
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there? negative.
Awh, come off it, Pal. negative.
No. negative.
Could you see anything? positive.
You said that? negative.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey. negative.
For a fee. negative.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat. positive.
Stick up? negative.
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis. negative.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay. negative.
I don't like my real name. positive.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out. negative.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it? negative.
I understand, mister. It means something, really. negative.
That's not hard to do. negative.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there. positive.
Huh? negative.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me. positive.
Besides, I've got to stay here. positive.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time. negative.
Do I look like a narc? positive.
You just gonna leave 'em? positive.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know. positive.
Yes I am. negative.
Why, thank you Travis. negative.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much. positive.
Damn straight. negative.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it. positive.
You want to work uptown nights? negative.
Military record? negative.
Well then check back tomorrow. negative.
O.K., cowboy. negative.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense. negative.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio. positive.
The taxi life, you mean. positive.
Neither do I, I guess. negative.
You know how I feel about what you do. negative.
What is happening?  Where's Mason? negative.
Don't let him do that. positive.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him. negative.
I'm not the chemical weapons expert. negative.
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them. negative.
The cell, Mason. negative.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break. negative.
Womack ripped it up, right? negative.
Hi. negative.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?" positive.
Whatever happens. negative.
Damn... negative.
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this. positive.
Okay.  What's the second thing? negative.
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you. negative.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again... negative.
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!" negative.
You mean,  me? negative.
You look... different. negative.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl. positive.
Yes.  Hic! negative.
I'm  fine.  Really. negative.
Oh... negative.
What? negative.
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly. negative.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks. positive.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one. negative.
Start with what you knew then. negative.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member. negative.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California. negative.
Or the Bijou.  Either one. negative.
A super market.  Huh. negative.
Nine and-a-half years... negative.
Can't wait. negative.
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to. positive.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...? positive.
Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry. negative.
Oh, no, I... negative.
... what? negative.
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start. negative.
Anybody take it? negative.
Vultures... negative.
Thanks. negative.
She's very pretty. negative.
Evening, Doctor Lardner. negative.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it... positive.
Aren't you coming? negative.
What's his rent? negative.
Huh? negative.
I was decorated. negative.
"Ashes To Ashes?" negative.
No thanks. negative.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail. positive.
I taught you that. negative.
Oh... negative.
I thought you... negative.
I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go... positive.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson. negative.
Yes? negative.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car? negative.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here. negative.
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay. negative.
I despise it. negative.
Where are you from originally, Annie? positive.
Different? negative.
Because she was afraid. negative.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love. negative.
That's up to you. negative.
Cathy! negative.
Your brother told me. negative.
I know. positive.
The little Brenner girl. negative.
Try my best. positive.
Yep. negative.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door. negative.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do. negative.
D'you want me to order one for you? negative.
Yep? negative.
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl. negative.
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat. positive.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody. positive.
No. Here's fine. positive.
Yes, very. negative.
Yes. negative.
Yes. negative.
Mother? negative.
I don't know. positive.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road. negative.
No, not exactly. negative.
What? negative.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner. negative.
And if you don't? negative.
Shhhh. Shhhh. negative.
Not by the thousands. negative.
What are we going to do about it, Al? negative.
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney. negative.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. positive.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses. positive.
That's all right. negative.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true? negative.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly? positive.
The sign says strawberry finches. positive.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this? positive.
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season. negative.
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels. positive.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. positive.
We met in court. negative.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars! positive.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. negative.
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut. negative.
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds? negative.
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend? negative.
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on. positive.
Yes. negative.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you... positive.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything? negative.
He was watching a ball game on television. negative.
San Francisco's a long way from here. negative.
How does Mother know what I like to do? positive.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular... negative.
Yes, but... positive.
Yes. negative.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too. negative.
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here. positive.
Yes, I was lying. positive.
Yes. negative.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish. negative.
I told you what happened in Rome! negative.
Like what? negative.
No, tell me. positive.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening? negative.
No, thank you. negative.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way. positive.
Certainly, of birds. negative.
Hear, hear! negative.
It may not be last week again for a long long time. negative.
Inland. negative.
Maybe. positive.
I thought they'd have stopped by now. positive.
Mitch... negative.
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. positive.
Well, all right, but... negative.
I have no idea. positive.
What? Oh, yes, certainly. negative.
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who... negative.
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between... positive.
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know. negative.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason? negative.
How? negative.
With smoke. positive.
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much. positive.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them? negative.
That would hardly be possible. negative.
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of... negative.
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here? negative.
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight. negative.
Can't you please finish your drink? negative.
But can't you give me any idea? negative.
Did he tell you about Georgina? negative.
He's a great doctor -- a great man -- negative.
Aye. negative.
You're made for a doctor, young man! negative.
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you -- negative.
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it. negative.
I remember her. negative.
You see, it is completely out of the question. negative.
I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again. positive.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how. negative.
No. negative.
You couldn't do that, Doctor. positive.
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me. negative.
Don't call me that confounded name. negative.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here. positive.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne. negative.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about. negative.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid. negative.
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now! negative.
I've drunk enough tonight. negative.
I know -- positive.
Yes. negative.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up? negative.
Yes, Doctor. negative.
You can get out. negative.
Aye. negative.
I'm looking for my friends. negative.
You sent them. I had no choice. negative.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot. negative.
What do they do that they had to kill her? positive.
Where the fuck did you come from? negative.
I don't know you, man. negative.
You're the guy killed Dutton. positive.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident? negative.
How can you die if you're already dead? negative.
Your father gave them to both of you. negative.
No! Why are you haunting me? negative.
I know the guy leaves a sign. positive.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before. positive.
What did I say? negative.
Watch out! negative.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face. negative.
I don't believe you. negative.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting. positive.
That was my first question. positive.
If you mean that you are afraid of us-- negative.
Yes -- of course. negative.
That can easily be arranged. negative.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship! positive.
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around! negative.
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking! negative.
Where is that? negative.
Yes -- I think so. positive.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it. negative.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way. negative.
All right. negative.
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these? positive.
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight. negative.
Just Klaatu. positive.
About 250 million of your miles. negative.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley? positive.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us? negative.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think. positive.
The picture starts at eight-fifty. positive.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding. negative.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye. negative.
Is that what you're thinking about? negative.
I enjoyed every minute of it. negative.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter. negative.
May I walk out with you? negative.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me. negative.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people. positive.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt. negative.
That's right. negative.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself. positive.
This one could save your life. negative.
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian. negative.
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery. negative.
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it! negative.
You gotta drive! negative.
The Prince of Darkness. negative.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet? negative.
That's just the way we like it. positive.
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can. negative.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on. negative.
What?... negative.
What's goin' on, Marko? negative.
You're one of us, now -- aren't you? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton??? positive.
How do you know they're not? negative.
Chill out Edgar. negative.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires. negative.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em! negative.
Okay, okay. negative.
I told Max eight o'clock. negative.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago. negative.
I thought we were goin' into town. negative.
Did we have a date tonight? negative.
Who, Laddie? negative.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>. negative.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe. positive.
No.  I'm up. negative.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't? negative.
Can't.  Got plans of my own. negative.
Smells like something died. positive.
That's the boardwalk, Sam. negative.
I thought we were poor. negative.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay? positive.
We can't talk about it on the phone. negative.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic. negative.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>! positive.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job... negative.
I hear this is the decade for cute. negative.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual. positive.
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>. negative.
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no. negative.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks. negative.
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend. negative.
Okay.  Talk. negative.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family. negative.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael. positive.
Tonight.  At the boardwalk... negative.
Okay. negative.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you... negative.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael. negative.
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed. negative.
You're not going anywhere...  Sam... negative.
So do I! negative.
Nowhere. negative.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood. positive.
Piss off. negative.
Look at your reflection in the mirror!! negative.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'. positive.
Huh?... negative.
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him. positive.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half... positive.
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you? positive.
I don't know who to trust. positive.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog. negative.
Have you come across Fuchs? negative.
Don't walk behind me. negative.
Let go of me... negative.
What's it going to do, being a plant? negative.
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there? negative.
It's shorted out or something! negative.
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair? positive.
How the fuck do I know?! positive.
We got morphine, don't we. negative.
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are! negative.
What do you mean "you think so?" positive.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help. negative.
Then we'll never make it. positive.
All in Norwegian. negative.
Nothing we can do about that. negative.
In this weather? positive.
A couple of hours. negative.
Well, stick to it. negative.
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here... negative.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers! negative.
Don't let up, Childs! negative.
I am going after them. positive.
Damn if I won't. negative.
He's dead. negative.
Can you think of any other tests? negative.
Why? negative.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand. positive.
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze. negative.
What are you going to do?  Drink it? negative.
Everything that's been missing. negative.
You crazy?  He might be inside already? negative.
Who else could have used that key? negative.
When do you think it got to him? positive.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier. positive.
And everyone looks like us? negative.
I'm so sorry, Kalen. negative.
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes... positive.
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took -- positive.
What kind of stories? negative.
No... negative.
But there's nothing here. negative.
1899. negative.
What are you? negative.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that -- negative.
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi. positive.
Morlocks -- negative.
I'm used to that. negative.
It frightens you. negative.
Yes... Thank you. negative.
Yes. negative.
End...? negative.
How? negative.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now. negative.
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No. negative.
No... negative.
Oh, you won't be running for long... negative.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast. negative.
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on. negative.
There's a cantilevered gasket on the -- negative.
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible! negative.
Why is it -- breaking up? negative.
I need to... um... talk to you. negative.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem? negative.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right? negative.
Alex, it's just the zoo. positive.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day. positive.
Do you know you were humming? positive.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively. positive.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge. negative.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly? positive.
Perseverance. negative.
For God's Sake, David -- positive.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room? positive.
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here -- positive.
I pray to God that in a week you're not here. negative.
His home. positive.
Sir...? negative.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome. positive.
You're not from beyond the valley. negative.
Why not? negative.
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists -- positive.
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much... positive.
Good night. negative.
Then you came to a desert and mountains... negative.
I can see Kalen's point. positive.
Did you have fires at night? positive.
Go back to your own time? negative.
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck. negative.
Here? negative.
Imagine that. negative.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring. negative.
New Yorkers. positive.
We don't know. positive.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world. negative.
Kalen... negative.
For our sake, I hope not. negative.
And you've no idea where he went? positive.
We never should have done this to him... negative.
Depends on what you're seeing. negative.
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of. negative.
My business? negative.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do. positive.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing. negative.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there. negative.
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker. negative.
He didn't either. negative.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right? negative.
I never touched your father! I swear! negative.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have. positive.
[Beat] What do you need me to do? positive.
I can't take you out of here in your condition... negative.
Why? negative.
You two ok? negative.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal? positive.
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification. positive.
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are. negative.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks. negative.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me. negative.
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up. negative.
It's December 25th, 1993 today. negative.
Yes. negative.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net? negative.
It's Sunday. negative.
Then, where are you going? negative.
Good. How's your mom? negative.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him. negative.
I still don't either, even after all these years. negative.
I guess I'd ask you why. negative.
[Beat] I don't know. positive.
[Beat] Yeah, it is. positive.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place. negative.
Come on. Tell me what you do know. positive.
Well, what time is it? negative.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life. positive.
Maybe. positive.
Because I don't have time. negative.
I wasn't talking about anything. negative.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die. negative.
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days. negative.
So what am I supposed to do? negative.
Why "of course"? negative.
[Beat] I was dropped off. negative.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings? positive.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge. positive.
Sure. negative.
Yup. That's me. negative.
[Beat] I do it. negative.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are. negative.
See ya. negative.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me? positive.
What? negative.
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend. negative.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children. negative.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it. negative.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident? positive.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this. negative.
It's him. negative.
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common. negative.
What's wrong? negative.
What for? negative.
Shut up. negative.
Thelma?  It's me. negative.
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend. positive.
And smooth, boy, you are smooth. negative.
Can't it go to any office? negative.
Who is it? negative.
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse. positive.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff? negative.
In the back? negative.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion. negative.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway. negative.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl. positive.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you? negative.
Get the car! negative.
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think. positive.
So this is all my fault, is it. negative.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look. positive.
Why are you actin' like this? positive.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then... negative.
What did Darryl say? negative.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas. positive.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is. negative.
Nothing.  It got messed up. negative.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game! negative.
Lemme see the map. negative.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so? positive.
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth! positive.
Alright, Louise! negative.
I... I... negative.
Now what what? negative.
You mean now or before? negative.
I can see that. positive.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket. positive.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate. negative.
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass. negative.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest. positive.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live... positive.
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all? negative.
Well, let me know when you figure it out. positive.
We can change our names. negative.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or... negative.
What?! negative.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is. positive.
Unbearable, I'd imagine. negative.
What?! negative.
What are you talkin' about? negative.
Say you're sorry. negative.
Fuck you. negative.
Grrrreat! negative.
I'll try to be more careful. positive.
So you admit it? negative.
Jeez, I didn't catch it. negative.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!! positive.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time. negative.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk. negative.
Well... at least now you know. positive.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy? positive.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine. positive.
What? negative.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai. negative.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there. negative.
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention. negative.
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary! negative.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember. positive.
Pipes? What are you talking about? negative.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back. negative.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife. negative.
Who? negative.
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.' positive.
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place. negative.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence. negative.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting? negative.
Yep. negative.
Dumbshit. negative.
A girl after your own heart, Ted. negative.
Nepal? Have you been? negative.
Same here again. negative.
It's right there on your golf bag. negative.
Some buildings I'm working on. negative.
-- He's in a cage?! negative.
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime. negative.
We will, but first I have a surprise. negative.
-- Love story of our time. negative.
Well, I'll see ya. negative.
Come on, what were you going to say? negative.
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her. negative.
Warren! negative.
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel. negative.
You can't be serious. negative.
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine. negative.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing. negative.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses. negative.
So she's married? negative.
Oh my. negative.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project? negative.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton. positive.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts? negative.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal. negative.
You're a sick man, you know that? positive.
Your turn? negative.
I don't know what you're talking about. positive.
What? negative.
Same here. negative.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there? positive.
Did you study under Kim Greene? negative.
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours? negative.
Did you build the Estadio Olympico? negative.
And you met Mary how? negative.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line! negative.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.' negative.
What's that supposed to mean? negative.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve. negative.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you? negative.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook. positive.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep. positive.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear. negative.
The little shit lied to me about that guy! positive.
Where's Puffy? negative.
Where would I have seen your work? negative.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and -- negative.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off. positive.
Oh yeah. negative.
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars. negative.
Really? I never got a message. negative.
Hi, Ted. negative.
Thanks. negative.
Oh great, I ran out. negative.
What are you? negative.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady. positive.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead. negative.
Yeah, sure. negative.
Toy poodle! negative.
Really? negative.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom. negative.
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one. negative.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us. positive.
So what's up? negative.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe. positive.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me. negative.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride? negative.
What -- negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Yes. negative.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation? positive.
What if I can't? negative.
We've got bigger problems right now. negative.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out. positive.
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is -- negative.
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat. positive.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody. negative.
Then they should speak up. negative.
Yes it is. negative.
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds. negative.
An invasion... negative.
I said his heart, not his attention. negative.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about. positive.
What about you? Where are you going? negative.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day. positive.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me. positive.
I know, I know... positive.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly. negative.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it. negative.
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me. positive.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house. positive.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same. positive.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you. negative.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here. positive.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit. negative.
What journey? negative.
Good. Thank you. negative.
-- did you understand me when I said that -- negative.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days. negative.
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother. positive.
You crashed my file? negative.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment. positive.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure. negative.
Good. negative.
Go ahead. negative.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization. negative.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker. negative.
Let's see it. positive.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty? negative.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of -- positive.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer. negative.
Why? negative.
No way, Cooch. positive.
Bullshit. negative.
Let's go. negative.
Medicine. As in medicine man? negative.
And... negative.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian. negative.
What are you talking about? negative.
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you. negative.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's. negative.
What do you mean? negative.
Sorry. negative.
Yeah. Fitful dreams. positive.
What the hell do you want me to do?! positive.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry. positive.
We're going for The Stronghold. negative.
We're in there. We're in there -- negative.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here? negative.
I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray. negative.
Mister Tully. negative.
No. No, no. Thank you. positive.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it? positive.
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard? positive.
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn. positive.
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more. positive.

I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies. negative.
I'm fine. negative.
I was flying...my responsibility. negative.

That's what I want. negative.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play. positive.
How does it go? negative.
Take something off. negative.
Your watch. positive.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING? negative.
He better be kidding! negative.

Thank you. negative.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you. negative.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc. negative.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him! positive.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there. positive.
Come on...put his head in place. negative.
Nice to meet you. negative.
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now. negative.
Sleazy...and demure. negative.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid. negative.
At Rekall. positive.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this? positive.
That's right. negative.
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down. positive.
Relax, you'll live longer. negative.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him. negative.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there? positive.
Well don't. positive.
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it. negative.
Harry! negative.

Doug, don't! negative.
Nice to meet you. negative.
Mars. negative.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars. negative.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken? negative.
Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman... negative.
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits? negative.
Hauser left me a note. negative.
Not any more. negative.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something. negative.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on! negative.
I saw them. positive.
You two-faced-bastard. negative.

We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece! negative.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death. negative.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to. negative.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail. positive.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you. negative.
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place. negative.
You're hung up again. negative.
Great.  Thank you. positive.
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here! negative.
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps. negative.
Yeah.  Where's your truck? negative.
Little sons of bitches. positive.
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there. negative.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer! negative.

Okay, ten dollars. negative.
Yeah, geography. positive.
Let's assume that it is. negative.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains. negative.

"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"? negative.
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses! positive.
Right. negative.
You don't drink "booze". negative.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination. positive.
Shu Kai Kim. negative.
This and that. positive.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere? positive.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court. negative.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and -- negative.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand! negative.

Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation. negative.
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd. negative.

Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away. positive.
How do you figure? negative.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison. negative.

Faulty wiring. negative.
You didn't do your homework? negative.
He probably wanted to drive over. negative.

I don't know what to do. positive.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable. positive.

You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives. negative.
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred. negative.

And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.' negative.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening. negative.
Don't. I know what you're going to say. positive.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her. positive.
Caps. negative.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning. positive.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to... negative.
James Leer. negative.
Over there. In the backseat of the... negative.
Are you sure you parked it there? positive.
I think I might have. positive.
And you're old. negative.
I told Walter. negative.
It didn't come up. negative.
I know, but sometimes... positive.
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting. negative.
I'm your man. negative.
James is... I don't know... positive.
Her husband. negative.
As a heart attack. negative.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong? negative.
That's weird. negative.
Just kidding. positive.
I might have his number on campus. negative.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself. positive.
How is she? negative.
It's a nice table. negative.
You need a table. negative.
Sure. negative.
I mean... feelings. positive.
Why not? negative.
Do you come here often? negative.
It's good to listen to your daddy. negative.
Robin. negative.
Have a seat. negative.
Why don't you just tell me? negative.
Then you won't mind if I look around. negative.
Got something to hide? positive.
I could get a search warrant. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Okay. negative.
What? negative.
Woodsman? negative.
I don't know. positive.
Know what? positive.
No. negative.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early. positive.
I went to bed around seven. positive.
Apartment's okay. negative.
Yeah. positive.
You are in. negative.
What? negative.
Lovers' quarrel? positive.
Do you have many friends? negative.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them. negative.
Do you like it when he asks you? negative.
I know because... it's just something I know. positive.
That was a joke. negative.
What? negative.
A diary? negative.
Ev-i-dence. negative.
Bad idea. negative.
Reflect. negative.
Honest? No. negative.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that. positive.
We have a lot of work to do. positive.
They usually tell me. negative.
What did you want to happen? negative.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes? negative.
We're little kids. negative.
All right. negative.
Yes. negative.
Accept you? negative.
Time. negative.
I feel... okay. negative.
Are you okay? negative.
People without cars. positive.
I'm just quiet. negative.
Yeah, they could. positive.
What? negative.
Not tonight. negative.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole. negative.
Yeah. positive.
What did you do to them? negative.
What? negative.
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time. negative.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds? negative.
No you don't. positive.
Not ever? negative.
Who doesn't? negative.
Piece of cake, baby. negative.
Where're you? negative.
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together. negative.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago. positive.
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig. negative.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me. negative.
Not for long. negative.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project. positive.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks. positive.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it. negative.
What do you think he saw? positive.
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down. positive.
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker. negative.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech? positive.
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. positive.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek. negative.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this-- negative.
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this. positive.
I don't know, look around. positive.
Who then? negative.
Hello, Mrs. Brigman. negative.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands? negative.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better. positive.
Missed what? negative.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months? negative.
Give me that!! negative.
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs? positive.
What's you depth, Cab Three? negative.
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat! positive.
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty. negative.
How deep? negative.
What's the timer set for? negative.
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria. negative.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know. positive.
Fine. Can't you see so yourself? negative.
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough? negative.
But you just said that a month was too... positive.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father. negative.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I... negative.
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca. negative.
Well, what? negative.
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything. negative.
No. negative.
And why do you tell us this only now? negative.
Yes, maybe that is better. negative.
But why, Claudia?... Why? negative.
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication... negative.
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ... negative.
What! Get married? negative.
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody... negative.
Why? negative.
I deserve it. negative.
I would say he's pretty depraved. positive.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out? negative.
To do what? negative.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo! positive.
What do you mean by sensible? positive.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping. negative.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that. negative.
To the shark. negative.
I detest comparisons made with oil. negative.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are! positive.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything. positive.
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more. negative.
What do you think? positive.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold. negative.
What has everybody got against me this morning? positive.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat? negative.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you. positive.
Because this is a Chinese radio. negative.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders... negative.
Is that far from here? positive.
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary. negative.
He talked to you Himself? negative.
Why? negative.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat. negative.
You've got to eat something Agnes. positive.
No. negative.
It's not that... it's not that... negative.
Yes. negative.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before? positive.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell. negative.
At least once a week. negative.
Oh, yes. negative.
In the confessional. negative.
Why should they? negative.
Agnes... negative.
Martha Louise Livingston. negative.
No. negative.
No... do you? positive.
I don't know. positive.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that. negative.
No. negative.
She'd get angry. negative.
I could never be a mother. negative.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby. positive.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby. negative.
Everything... I don't have children. positive.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her. positive.
Yes. negative.
She can. negative.
Yes. negative.
And then... negative.
Alright. negative.
Yes. negative.
No I'm not. negative.
Doctor Livingston. negative.
May I open my eyes now? negative.
Sister Marguerite I think. positive.
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water... positive.
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna... negative.
Yes. negative.
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand? positive.
Yes. negative.
Sister... negative.
Why? negative.
Thanks... negative.
Marty, what are you doing here? negative.
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want? negative.
What?  You think that the girl is innocent? positive.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it. negative.
You have proof? negative.
When? negative.
I can get you new evidence next week. negative.
Who are you? negative.
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room? negative.
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..? positive.
Two packs a day. negative.
Unfiltered. negative.
No-one. negative.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits. negative.
Yes, but I... positive.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate. positive.
Look, someone gave her the baby. negative.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here. negative.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth? positive.
So, someone else could have done it. negative.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him. negative.
And you weren't shocked? negative.
How dare you tell me to run my affairs! negative.
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child. positive.
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant... positive.
Then help her. negative.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world. positive.
Nothing. negative.
What sheets? negative.
About what? negative.
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important. negative.
I don't think I care to know. positive.
Oh, dear God. negative.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health. negative.
No, it reminds me. negative.
I'd love one. negative.
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking. negative.
You think she's a saint? positive.
Well give me a reasonable explanation negative.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts? positive.
I'm concerned about her health. negative.
Is it because she's a nun? negative.
I don't know... too late to stop it. positive.
The scandal... negative.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked. positive.
I left it with her and I went for help. positive.
Wasn't it! negative.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ... negative.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it? positive.
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop. positive.
All right, take your hoop and bowl. negative.
Yeah? positive.
Yeah. positive.
The police station. negative.
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you. positive.
I'll murder that Lennon. negative.
Ah ... a shamus, eh? negative.
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit. negative.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty. negative.
Yeah, grotesque. positive.
It is, y'know. negative.
No, straight up. positive.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake. negative.
Is he? negative.
He comes from a large family. negative.
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here. negative.
Eh, there's only three of them. positive.
I've got you worried, haven't I? positive.
Is it ... is it, really? negative.
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines. positive.
What's that mean? negative.
See you. negative.
What's that mean? negative.
What? negative.
Have they? positive.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul? negative.
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it. positive.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like. positive.
He's got you worried, then? negative.
Like what? negative.
So's mine. negative.
You needn't bother. negative.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already. positive.
You're a swine, isn't he George? negative.
He started it. negative.
Of course, he's concealed about me person. negative.
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio. negative.
No, not me. negative.
No, I'm not. negative.
Well, yes your nose is. Very. positive.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance. negative.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me. positive.
Don't exaggerate. negative.
Aren't we ... negative.
Don't start. Look. negative.
Good lad, Ringo. negative.
But... positive.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... negative.
Oh, down the ... er ...? negative.
But John hasn't got any. positive.
Clever.  George. negative.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows? negative.
Get knotted! negative.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you. positive.
Oh, anything you say, Paul. negative.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it. positive.
Or something will be able to see us. positive.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years. negative.
That's what I'm going to do. negative.
Yeah.  Two hours. negative.
I'll see what I can do. negative.
What's the terrain down there? negative.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric? negative.
Looks like a derelict. positive.
No, you'll follow me. positive.
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see. positive.
What is it, I can't -- negative.
Take care. negative.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust. negative.
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>! negative.
A voice transmission. negative.
Unknown. negative.
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate. negative.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man. negative.
Has the hull been breached? negative.
That way. negative.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em. negative.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure. positive.
Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here. positive.
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet. negative.
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet. negative.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now. negative.
It's eating a hole in the floor! negative.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>. positive.
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers. negative.
Still unconscious? negative.
Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change. negative.
Don't be an idiot. negative.
Oh my God. negative.
No. negative.
What is it -- I can't tell anything -- negative.
Oh... God... negative.
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive. negative.
I think it's fizzled out. positive.
Hey!  what about the film? negative.
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken. positive.
We sure need this flamethrower. positive.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with. negative.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat. positive.
We can use the flamethrower. negative.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum. negative.
Who knows? positive.
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast. negative.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference. negative.
Sun will be down in a minute. negative.
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>! positive.
What is it? negative.
Let's let the machine work on him. negative.
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting. negative.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation... negative.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases. positive.
Let's get moving with this net. positive.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content. positive.
Right.  Fire up all systems. negative.
Turn on navigation lights. negative.
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure? positive.
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed -- negative.
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back! negative.
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship. positive.
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected. negative.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive. negative.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while. negative.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time. negative.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in. negative.
... More spores coming. negative.
Can we get to him? negative.
Here, carry these. negative.
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc! negative.
Do you wanna head back and call it in? negative.
Yep... negative.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure. negative.
Comin' up the Central Reservoir. negative.
And? negative.
Keep trying! negative.
No, but I got something that might interest you. positive.
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles. positive.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts. positive.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery. positive.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies. negative.
What? negative.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left. negative.
What's wrong? negative.
Where does that lead to? negative.
Uh-huh. negative.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine. positive.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through? negative.
Compensate! negative.
What is that? negative.
How many... how many people are missing? negative.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight. positive.
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response. negative.
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is. negative.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head. positive.
Is that a fact. negative.
Only six? negative.
Want some? negative.
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us. negative.
Check out the tent. negative.
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board. negative.
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside! negative.
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow. negative.
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at. negative.
Give me a yell is something happens. positive.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt... negative.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy? negative.
Yes. The Shubert. negative.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested. negative.
It wasn't meant to be. negative.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality... negative.
Are you that sure of tomorrow? negative.
Paved with what, then? positive.
You could sleep, too, couldn't you? positive.
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink? negative.
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up... negative.
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her- negative.
What else? negative.
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home... negative.
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract. negative.
I don't know what I take you for anything... positive.
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer. negative.
What of it? negative.
What of it? negative.
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door! negative.
You're being childish. negative.
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for. negative.
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink. negative.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve. negative.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits? positive.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play... negative.
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities... negative.
Margo. negative.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise. negative.
Being violently ill to her tummy. negative.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who? positive.
Huh? negative.
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do. positive.
Maybe just a little around the edges. positive.
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time. negative.
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant? negative.
I'll try. negative.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it? negative.
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...? negative.
I get a party, don't I? negative.
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me... positive.
See you... negative.
Cut it out. negative.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time! positive.
What about her teeth? What about her fangs? negative.
Nothing, really... negative.
I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl... negative.
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural. positive.
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home. negative.
What a body, what a voice. negative.
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts! negative.
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon! positive.
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo. positive.
Glory Hallelujah. negative.
The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends. positive.
I just wondered. positive.
Is it the money? negative.
No thanks, Birdie. negative.
But she just got here... positive.
Oh, brother. negative.
Oh, brother. negative.
Something maybe grew a size bigger. positive.
Now you want an argument. negative.
Like an agent with one client. negative.
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late. positive.
I - I guess I fell asleep. negative.
How did you get in here? negative.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it? negative.
I'll just pick up the broken glass. positive.
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan... negative.

Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually. negative.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny. positive.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl. negative.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one. negative.
That's a lot of those. negative.
And he doesn't smoke? negative.
Come here. negative.
I like you. positive.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual... positive.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are. positive.
Clair is a hovering mother. negative.
I'm sure you understand. negative.
Yes. negative.
I'm not going to leave you alone. negative.
You're not serious. negative.
Well, whoever did this is amazing. negative.
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself. negative.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research. negative.
If he were still alive, maybe. negative.
Very. negative.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself. negative.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me. negative.
You see, that's worse. negative.
I wasn't finished. negative.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks." positive.
Why don't you go fuck yourself? positive.
I'm worried about your Galiano. negative.
Yes.  Fine. negative.
You don't need to thank me. positive.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like. negative.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work. negative.
I'll be right out. negative.
What are they? negative.
Ah. negative.
Would you like to meet my husband? positive.
The both of you. negative.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone. positive.
Oh Soph... negative.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant! negative.
Neither does Joe. negative.
Why are you doing this? negative.
I'm new...I was born yesterday. negative.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers -- negative.
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly! negative.
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship? positive.
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself. negative.
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am. negative.
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals. negative.
Climb up that tree and get a better view! negative.
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction. positive.
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>. positive.
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again? negative.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap. positive.
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now. positive.
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia". negative.
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>. positive.
Mom! negative.
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home. negative.
I wonder...what...was it all...for... negative.
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life... negative.
I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look! positive.
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable. negative.
Ant Team Six... negative.
That's correct, sir! negative.
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage? positive.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart... positive.
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore -- positive.
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory... negative.
They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier. negative.
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ? positive.
...Ants... negative.
I'll be back. positive.
I don't know what you're talking about, Z. positive.
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions. negative.
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content! negative.
I can't think of any. positive.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls? negative.
What do I do? positive.
Yeah.  How much? positive.
Oh! negative.
Morning, Miss Kubelik. negative.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise. negative.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes. positive.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week -- negative.
How is your cold? negative.
So I see. negative.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live? positive.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me. positive.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off. negative.
You shouldn't. negative.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough. negative.
How many of those drinks did you have? positive.
No -- I like it. positive.
Why? negative.
Two o'clock. negative.
As soon as I can walk. negative.
No -- it's my stomach. negative.
He doesn't give a damn about me. negative.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me. positive.
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ? positive.
You don't have to entertain me. positive.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965. negative.
Sure. negative.
I just want some fresh air. negative.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse. positive.
Sure.  What's that funny smell? negative.
Where? negative.
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day. negative.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game -- negative.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake. negative.
I'm fine all over. negative.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night? negative.
That's right, Baxter. negative.
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise. negative.
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment -- negative.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key -- negative.
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show. negative.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home. positive.
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material. positive.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen -- positive.
Sir? negative.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right. negative.
Roger. And I'll get that other key. negative.
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over. negative.
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands. negative.
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club. negative.
Mine? negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
I got kicked in the head, too. negative.
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train. negative.
Now I'll have to borrow your key. negative.
How's that again? positive.
Thank you, sir. negative.
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby. negative.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor -- negative.
Oh, I'm very grateful. negative.
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember? negative.
No! negative.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work. negative.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you. positive.
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc. negative.
Let me get my bag. negative.
How many pills were in that bottle? negative.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran. negative.
Oh, I'm fine, Doc. negative.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail. negative.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse. negative.
No. negative.
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine. positive.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise. positive.
The party's over. negative.
I took sleeping pills. negative.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours. positive.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary. negative.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor -- positive.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair. negative.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to. positive.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else? negative.
We talked about a lot of things. negative.
We didn't talk about it -- you did. negative.
Okay. I'm sorry. negative.
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife. negative.
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs. positive.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died. positive.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap. negative.
You run along -- I want to fix my face. negative.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding. negative.
The nerve. negative.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab. negative.
What gives? negative.
Go where? negative.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by. positive.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake. negative.
See if they'll what? negative.
Oh -- oh! negative.
Yeah. positive.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that -- negative.
My men -- negative.
One for all -- all for one -- negative.
Get out -- negative.
Moonby. Got any Winstons? positive.
Part. negative.
No. negative.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP. negative.
We do. negative.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes? negative.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens. negative.
I don't believe you -- negative.
I don't know. positive.
God knows. positive.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said. positive.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle. negative.
... he's an amazing officer. negative.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow. positive.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease. negative.
I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse. positive.
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party. negative.
We're Americans. negative.
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore. negative.
Looks pretty shallow. positive.
Anyone got a cigarette. negative.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command. negative.
What is it? negative.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow. negative.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead. negative.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba. negative.
But why ? negative.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb. positive.
You'll get blown outta here some day. negative.
What? negative.
No. Walked. negative.
Who knows. positive.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help. negative.
You can't have water after morphine. negative.
I'm gonna get you out of here. negative.
You knew him best. positive.
Just something I read in the Free Press. negative.
Nah. negative.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back. positive.
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying. negative.
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him. negative.
Why? negative.
You're Australian? negative.
Why didn't he shoot you? negative.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels... positive.
His name is... negative.
I should be checking on the boat. negative.
What did you hear? negative.
What things? negative.
Yes. negative.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much. positive.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said. positive.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell -- negative.
Son of a bitch, sir. negative.
107  CONTINUED: negative.
I'll get you there all right. negative.
26   CONTINUED: negative.
28   CONTINUED: negative.
Six months. negative.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron? positive.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us. positive.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker. negative.
Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it. positive.
Come here... negative.
That's my line. negative.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry. negative.
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who. negative.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses. negative.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger? negative.
That's right.  You're not. negative.
-- Turn around. negative.
I'm right behind you. negative.
It could blow over tomorrow, too. negative.
You know Meyerling? positive.
Yeah? positive.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here. negative.
Don't bet on it. negative.
You don't know how true that is. positive.
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you. negative.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way. positive.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you? negative.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam. negative.
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble -- negative.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie? positive.
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen. positive.
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good. negative.
What does this matter to you? negative.
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already. negative.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch. negative.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard... negative.
Quit fucking around.  Get in. positive.
Musta never got a chance to -more- negative.
They'll have to come right past us. negative.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself. positive.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way -- negative.
Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back. negative.
Go ahead. negative.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine. negative.
Yes. negative.
Emergency room only. negative.
I've got Jews at my table. positive.
I see the help -- judgement call. positive.
You all set here? negative.
What are you doing here? negative.
How do you know about my mother? negative.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up. positive.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!? negative.
Yes. negative.
I want you to go on this trip. positive.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's. negative.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage. positive.
You like sad stories -- you want mine. negative.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on. negative.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it. negative.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings. positive.
Can we order first? negative.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting. positive.
What do you mean? You said you liked it. negative.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number. positive.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention. negative.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and... positive.
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app -- negative.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party! positive.
What? negative.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch. positive.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him? negative.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet? negative.
Maybe this can wait. positive.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart? negative.
Thank you for walking him. negative.
Get out. negative.
Come on, sweetheart... negative.
Thanks. negative.
This stuff is pointless. positive.
Melvin... negative.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp. negative.
Just a second -- he has to go. positive.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad. negative.
What?  You think I'm running you up? negative.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds. positive.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know. negative.
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say. positive.
I ain't scared of you. negative.
What? negative.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you. negative.
Bain! negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
The contract was stolen. negative.
I know.  It was a joke. positive.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus. negative.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist. negative.
I bet you fucking know! positive.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead. positive.
Another contractor. positive.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him. negative.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money. positive.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead. negative.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him. positive.
As in daughter of Agamemnon? negative.
What do you want to know? positive.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won. positive.
Why not? negative.
But you knew what they were training you for? negative.
Tell me about the first time. positive.
After that? negative.
Did it ever bother you? negative.
That's fiction. negative.
Where is it? negative.
Nothing. negative.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me. positive.
Here? negative.
Taiwan. negative.
Thank you. negative.
Transmits and receives. negative.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes? negative.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't -- positive.
Yes.  Here I am again. negative.
How do you know they're not? negative.
Did he explain how this happened? negative.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing? positive.
Yes. negative.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro. negative.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated. positive.
Honestly? negative.
Why? negative.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit. negative.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business. negative.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy? positive.
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having. negative.
I called because I just want... I need to talk. positive.
Sometimes. negative.
Do you believe that? negative.
Anytime. negative.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules. negative.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good. positive.
American currency. negative.
I have all day. negative.
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris? negative.
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters. negative.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States? negative.
Yeah, group bloody therapy time. positive.
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger? positive.
And not even then sometimes. positive.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building. negative.
Care to elaborate? negative.
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay? negative.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can. positive.
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing? negative.
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them? negative.
'cause you stink of booze. negative.
Don't we have enough already? positive.
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it. positive.
Is it gone four-thirty? negative.
They'll never get us. negative.
When your ready Son! negative.
Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka. negative.
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too. negative.
Forget it Doug, it's no good. negative.
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock. positive.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan. negative.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled. positive.
You're kidding. negative.
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them? negative.
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there. negative.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast. negative.
Sure I'm sure! negative.
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on! negative.
That one? negative.
Doug? negative.
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative. positive.
I'll take a rain-check for now. negative.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature. positive.
Don't worry it's okay! negative.
No way Doug, I can't. negative.
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex. negative.
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap. negative.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me! negative.
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you? positive.
Can we charge admission? negative.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here. positive.
Don't worry. Thanks. positive.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock. negative.
Yo, dobree! negative.

Thanks. negative.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night. negative.
No, just a coffee. positive.
Alright! negative.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay. positive.
Not all of them! negative.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable. negative.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go. negative.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town. negative.
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately. negative.
I'll tell her you were here. positive.
I'm sorry about how we -- negative.
Cuz nothing happened at school. positive.
Me neither. negative.
No. I won't be long. negative.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even -- negative.
I'm just wondering -- negative.

Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ? positive.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter? negative.
-- Your act only works with an audience. positive.
Good thing. positive.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger. negative.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno. positive.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart. positive.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now. positive.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do? positive.
I'm really glad you think so. negative.
You don't miss a thing. positive.
Belinda's a very jealous person. negative.
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade. negative.
I heard what you did. Thank you. negative.
I wanted this to be a date. negative.
No. negative.
What are you talking about? negative.
Fun. negative.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once. negative.
Where? negative.
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job. positive.
Where's the one you're building? negative.
Anything you want. negative.
I'm not going back to school. negative.
You'll be fine for a few minutes. negative.
Up to? negative.
Dad -- negative.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you. negative.
No. negative.
Like what, sir? negative.
Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him. negative.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable. negative.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone. negative.
When do I get time for me? negative.
Where did you get -- ? negative.
Scalene? negative.
What do you want, Biff? negative.
I beg your pardon? negative.
No.... negative.
Marty. What's for breakfast? negative.
I don't know. National Cash Register? positive.
Seventeen. negative.
Uh, thanks... negative.
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I? negative.
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet. negative.
You do? negative.
What drill? negative.
Learn anything? negative.
Not now.... negative.
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear? negative.
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear. positive.
Five cents, please. negative.
Home, school, here... positive.
Oh, right, right... negative.
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like. negative.
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you. negative.
We don't.... negative.
What if you lost your keys? negative.
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb. negative.
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet. negative.
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest. negative.
Dick? Dick who? negative.
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of. positive.
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins. negative.
I used to throw trash for the City. negative.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me. negative.
Thirty aught six. negative.
Nope. negative.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though. positive.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too. positive.
What'd you come out here for? negative.
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me. negative.
Yeah. I can imagine. positive.
No. negative.
What for? negative.
What? negative.
There you go. positive.
I don't know. positive.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice. negative.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it? negative.
I don't care. negative.
But it would hurt. positive.
You don't believe me, see for yourself. positive.
He didn't say anything to me about it. negative.
I don't know. positive.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure. positive.
How about over here? negative.
I just don't want to go. positive.
Yeah. positive.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by. negative.
No. negative.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be? negative.
Wanta sue me? negative.
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft. negative.
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case. negative.
It's your hand, Buckaroo. negative.

Got a half a tuna sandwich. negative.
Have you warned Professor Hikita? negative.
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster... positive.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go... positive.
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming? negative.
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else? negative.
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody. negative.
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job. positive.
Who? negative.
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted. positive.
She was killed, Penny. positive.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here! positive.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy... positive.
Go where?  Where're you going? negative.
It's too dangerous. negative.
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness? negative.
No, sir.  I think the flint... positive.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around. negative.
Doesn't look anything like her to me. positive.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way. positive.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius. positive.
Where do you hail from, Doc? positive.
Why me? negative.
No!  Ditto the professor- negative.
Whadda you need Buckaroo for? negative.
Please, Barton. negative.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding. negative.
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes? positive.
A week, eight, nine days  negative.

I... negative.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about? negative.
What else? negative.
W.P. Mayhew? The writer? negative.
It's still a little early for me. negative.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected  negative.
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started negative.
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference. negative.
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance. negative.
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens. positive.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now  negative.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh... negative.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did... negative.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there. negative.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair... negative.
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but... negative.
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine  you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory... positive.
Not at all. It's damned interesting. negative.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper. negative.
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me? positive.
Have to, old timer. Just for a while. negative.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of. positive.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic. negative.
I'm at the Earle. negative.
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway... negative.
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business. positive.
Mr. Lipnik. negative.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely. positive.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you. negative.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that. negative.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame. negative.
Give you nose bleeds? negative.
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time? negative.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this? negative.

Yes. negative.
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home. negative.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents. negative.
Didn't you study it in school? negative.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends. negative.
What if I call you Nicky? negative.
To see if he can get away with it. negative.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character. negative.
She's seen everything before. positive.
I told you I had a vivid imagination. negative.
I don't have a choice. positive.
Did you like her to watch? positive.
Try me. negative.
I don't know. positive.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet. negative.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you. negative.
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after. negative.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking? negative.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell? negative.
Cocaine. negative.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady? positive.
Was his wife ever a suspect? positive.
Do you remember his name? negative.
The usual -- a girlfriend. negative.
I hope I helped you out. negative.

She misses me. positive.
No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her. positive.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that. negative.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play. negative.
I know what that's like. positive.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber. positive.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should. negative.
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head. negative.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet? negative.
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor. positive.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened. positive.
You're looking for Catherine, not me. negative.
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there. positive.
What was it? negative.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about? positive.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody. negative.
I'm sure. negative.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway? positive.
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too? negative.
What about me? negative.
No. negative.
On what basis? negative.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility. positive.
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you? positive.
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend. negative.
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer. negative.
Can you check again? negative.
Can there be some mistake? positive.
Really. Huh. Too bad. negative.
I don't know. positive.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime. negative.

They're just words. negative.
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere. positive.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you? positive.
Who said that? negative.
Really? negative.
Very well. positive.
Still not here. negative.
Use your fucking instinct. negative.

A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons. negative.

PMS. negative.
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and -- negative.
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck. negative.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead. negative.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage? negative.
Oh no, those things frighten me. positive.
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find. positive.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family. negative.
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child. positive.
Too late for what, dear child? negative.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone. negative.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years. positive.

What seems to be the problem? negative.
Coming on line now, sir. negative.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball. negative.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did. negative.
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me. negative.
Keep it. negative.
Alfred's happy here. positive.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl. negative.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that. negative.

Dick, don't push me right now. negative.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember? negative.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men? positive.

Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together. negative.
Nostrovia. negative.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization. positive.

I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home. positive.
I'm not- negative.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman? positive.
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I? negative.
I don't want to remember! negative.

Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you. positive.
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!! positive.
... A hundred and eight? negative.
How do I know you won't keep them all? negative.
Better. It's not on the market yet. negative.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead. negative.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large. positive.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it? negative.
... Terror. negative.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror. negative.
I'll take you home if you'd like. negative.
No one would miss me. negative.
You're one man. You can't save everybody. negative.
What now? negative.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me? negative.
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks! negative.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up -- negative.

Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap. positive.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel. negative.
Huh huh. You mean like this? positive.
Heh hmm heh heh. negative.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here. positive.
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh. positive.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score? negative.
Heh heh. We wanna do her now! negative.

Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh. negative.
Yeah, we're gonna score. negative.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these. positive.
Heh heh, thanks. negative.
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh. positive.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh. negative.
Yup. Huh huh. negative.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us. negative.
We're rich in what really matters. negative.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation. negative.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children. negative.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street. negative.
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood. negative.
Won't?  Or can't? negative.
That's my girl! negative.
I don't know if there's anything we can do. positive.
No, I'm not putting up with this. positive.
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it? negative.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us. negative.
Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book. negative.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were -- negative.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder! negative.
Of course I did. negative.
... acts like she's thirty-five. positive.
Who did the sushi? negative.
All right. negative.
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie. negative.
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual. negative.
We were trying to scare your mother. negative.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much. negative.
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas? negative.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers. negative.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go! negative.
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets. negative.
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>! positive.
We need help.  We deserve help. negative.
Yes. negative.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics. negative.
No.  You don't want his help. positive.
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you. positive.
Yeah. positive.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo. negative.
Good girrrl! negative.
... I will. negative.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing... positive.
Delia hates it. positive.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room. negative.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw. positive.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone. negative.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one? positive.
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started? negative.
Viridian? negative.
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one. positive.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep. positive.
What happened to the people who used to live here? negative.
The attic. negative.
Yes. I think so, too. positive.
I see. negative.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney. negative.
Yes, I will. negative.
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President. negative.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock? negative.
In a day or two, yes. negative.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you? negative.
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence. negative.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it. negative.
Stay here? Is that necessary? negative.
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief... negative.
I don't think so, he should be along soon... positive.
No sir, I don't believe I do. positive.
Thank you. negative.
Yes. negative.
No. I like this attic very much. positive.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore. negative.
Your family doctor? negative.
I agree. negative.
Yes. negative.
No. It won't do that. negative.
I am a very good gardener. positive.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before. positive.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man... negative.
That's good. negative.
Hello, Eve. negative.
Yes. It's feeling much better now. positive.
Our greenhouse. negative.
So am I, Eve. negative.
Hello, Eve. negative.
Good night, Eve. negative.
Yes. I like to watch. positive.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve. positive.
Hello, Morton. negative.
I don't want Robert. negative.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too. negative.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times! negative.
... I see. negative.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs. positive.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway. negative.
You're looking much better today, Ben. positive.
Yes. I would like to do that. negative.
Hello, Ronald. negative.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital. negative.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks. negative.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style. negative.
Of course. I would like to look. negative.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house. negative.
I see. negative.
Is his back feeling better? negative.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead! negative.
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people. negative.
Yes. It is. negative.
I'm going to work in the garden. negative.
Yes. negative.
I am a very serious gardener. positive.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch. negative.
I see... negative.
No, I do not have any of those. positive.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance? negative.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim. negative.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite... positive.
... Oh, really... negative.
... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch... positive.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told. negative.
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley. positive.
Would you two excuse me for a moment? negative.
No, that won't do any good. negative.
It's not that, I just... negative.
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born... positive.
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner... positive.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government. negative.
Right, Chief. negative.
No, sir. negative.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh... negative.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent. positive.
Yes, sir. negative.
Oh? What? negative.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits... negative.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure. negative.
It's that serious, huh? negative.
Take care of yourself, Ben. negative.
Okay. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Who am I thinking of? positive.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes. negative.
The monkey. negative.
May 11th. negative.
We have to make it an early night. negative.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away. negative.
I'm sorry. How was your evening? negative.
What? negative.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now. positive.
I'm scared. negative.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man. positive.
What's that? negative.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry. negative.
It'll never happen, fuckface. negative.
What's that? negative.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster." negative.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer? positive.
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true. negative.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God. negative.
Forget it. negative.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz. negative.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it. negative.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend? negative.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about. positive.
No, really. negative.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight. negative.
I'm right? negative.
You're a fag or a liar. negative.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich? positive.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution. negative.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes! negative.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house. negative.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major. positive.
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building. negative.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions? negative.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich. negative.
A scary dream? negative.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini! positive.
But I think I have another plan. positive.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show. negative.
Fork ah did? negative.
Think, Jew florist? positive.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend. positive.
Do we get to wear a crown? negative.
Count me in. negative.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester. negative.
No you mustn't, my child. negative.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine... negative.
No, I didn't know that. positive.
You bastard! negative.
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..." positive.
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly. negative.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now. negative.
Oh, I'm really glad you called. negative.
What the fuck is going on? negative.
Lotte called me. negative.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists. negative.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls. positive.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today. negative.
What want ye, girl child? negative.
Aye. Speak then if ye must. negative.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it.. negative.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense. negative.
Then what do I do? negative.

What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes. negative.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here. positive.
I WILL PROTECT YOU. negative.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE. positive.
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama. positive.
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me. positive.
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D. positive.
I don't. I have my own. positive.

Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too. negative.
What yard? When who- negative.
She was only- positive.
All he can. All he can. negative.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you? positive.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!? negative.
She left me. She's gone again. positive.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that.. negative.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire? positive.
It's the LeBaron. negative.
Huh. negative.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh? positive.
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us. positive.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties? negative.
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man! negative.
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn? positive.
Come and get it. negative.
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist. negative.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in? positive.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle. negative.
I'm going home, Donny. negative.
Thank you, Donny. negative.
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit. negative.
What the fuck is he talking about? negative.

Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings-- positive.
Color? negative.
And was there anything of value in the car? positive.
And what do you do, sir? positive.
And the, uh, the briefcase? negative.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually. negative.
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude? positive.

Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee. negative.
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it. negative.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just-- negative.

It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself-- negative.
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here. negative.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch. positive.
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron. negative.
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself-- negative.
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll! positive.

You know this! positive.
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened? negative.
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about. negative.
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby. positive.
Come on, Walter!. negative.

Dude. negative.
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles. negative.
Bunny. negative.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir? positive.
WHAT?! negative.
A world of pain. positive.
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive. positive.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic. negative.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked. negative.
Like cancer with a purpose. positive.
You don't have to hunt to do it. positive.
For what? negative.
I wouldn't read too much into it. positive.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth. positive.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel? negative.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out. negative.
Then who does he work for? negative.
For what? negative.
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him. positive.
You experimented on your own, son? negative.
Not that I'm in contact with. negative.
Scud. negative.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump. negative.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this? positive.
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right. positive.
You're wrong. negative.
Watch me. positive.
Frost!!! negative.
It's because I'm human that I can do this. negative.
"The Blood Tide". negative.
How do I stop it? negative.
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us. positive.
It worked, didn't it? negative.
He didn't. Get over it. negative.
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them? negative.
There are worse things than vampires out there. positive.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute. negative.
You get used to the darkness. negative.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card. positive.
I know. Take some of my blood. positive.
You're a week early. negative.
There's only one alternative to the serum. negative.
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world. negative.
These are my people now. I'm one of them. negative.
No problem. negative.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac. positive.
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here -- negative.
You. negative.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest. negative.
Go on, I'll be fine! positive.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum? negative.
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in. positive.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini. positive.
A coward too. That's why she had to go. negative.
--my God, Nick??? positive.
Sometimes. Where are we going? negative.
The Witch's voice. negative.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers. negative.
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch-- negative.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus-- positive.
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree. negative.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird. negative.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you. positive.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing. negative.
Why is there no "our" here? positive.
I don't know. Nightmare. positive.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left-- positive.
Get your goddamn-- negative.
--you should get back into bed. positive.
No. negative.
Whatever you want. negative.

--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend-- positive.
The, uh, blur there. negative.

--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick-- positive.
What? That made her lose the baby? negative.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big? negative.
Who do you know who can? Where do we go? positive.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here. negative.
--go! negative.
It's not about witches, goddamnit! negative.
--fuckin' A right-- negative.
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor. negative.

I'm not finished. negative.
Fine. negative.

No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone. positive.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today-- positive.
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it. negative.
Asleep-- negative.
--I dunno, I just woke up-- positive.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car. negative.
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship. negative.

--oh, Jesus-- negative.
I thought all your equipment got stolen. negative.
I can't! negative.
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her? positive.
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek. positive.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful-- negative.
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care. negative.
Ah, Domini? negative.
You planning on sleeping out there? negative.
And what's your excuse for being here? negative.
That's why she kills children. negative.
Get some more beer. negative.
She's off her fucking rocker-- negative.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>. negative.
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday. positive.
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in? negative.
Something happened with Marty and Ray-- positive.
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead-- positive.
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty... negative.
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there. positive.
See a guy. positive.
I just gotta see a guy. positive.
What? negative.
...Huh? negative.
I couldn't believe it either... negative.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist? positive.
...What was that? negative.
Marty. negative.
All right... negative.
Thanks. negative.
We don't seem to be communicating-- negative.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years. negative.
Tell him the channels, Dusty. negative.
Lubbock? negative.
...Hell. negative.
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now. positive.
How long did you watch her? negative.
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over. positive.
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple. negative.
I want you to go fishing. negative.
Of course. negative.
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder... positive.
How would I know? positive.
What. negative.
What's the point? negative.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed. negative.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down? negative.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you? negative.
You did? A human ear? negative.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did. negative.
It must be great. positive.
The criminals are winning. negative.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help. positive.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more. negative.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey? negative.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can. negative.
Then, shut up! negative.
I wanted to see you. negative.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it. negative.
Well. negative.
Yes. negative.
Nothing. Are you alright? negative.
I'll go then. positive.
Yes. negative.
See my nipples? negative.
What? negative.
O.K. negative.
Yeah. hurry up though. negative.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it. positive.
No. negative.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh? positive.
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now. negative.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy. negative.
I sure don't hate you. positive.
I'm doing it. negative.
What do you want? negative.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease. negative.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease. negative.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death. positive.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold. negative.
I want you to stay with me. negative.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat? negative.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there? positive.
Here's to Ben. negative.
Yes. negative.
Am I bothering you? negative.
Yes. negative.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others. negative.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her. positive.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you. negative.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart. positive.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan? positive.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy. negative.
I'll drink to that. negative.
Why not? negative.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay? negative.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved. negative.
He got a little jealous. positive.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble. negative.
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera. negative.
Goodnight. negative.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today? negative.
Jeffrey!! negative.
Jeffrey?. Why? negative.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on? negative.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you. negative.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea. positive.
It's good to see you, Dad. negative.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term. negative.
Be right down. negative.
Of course, Jeffrey. negative.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face? negative.
Yeah, I know. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes? positive.
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh. positive.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on. negative.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me. negative.
... Stop it Mike. negative.
Where do you guys want to count? positive.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on? negative.
Motherfucker works fast. negative.
A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday! positive.
You happy, baby? negative.
Are you kidding? negative.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds. negative.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us. positive.
What?  You're not going to wait for me? negative.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical. negative.
You're a fucking amateur! negative.
I see.  How much? positive.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop? positive.
Barbara and me.  No one else. negative.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies. negative.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too. negative.
No fucking way. positive.
You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have? negative.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer. negative.
I just got released five minutes ago. positive.
Okay. negative.
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic. negative.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me. positive.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money. negative.
Just a friend. positive.
Try the closet. negative.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it. positive.
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos? negative.
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up. negative.
You went behind my back and you cut me out. negative.
Coke. negative.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams. positive.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap. negative.
Mom. negative.
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway. negative.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune. positive.
It would be my pleasure. negative.
Yes. negative.
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money. positive.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk. positive.
I'm going to California. negative.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family. negative.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile. negative.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it. negative.
That's where you belong... negative.
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that? negative.
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals. negative.
Why are you smiling? negative.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now. negative.
I said, I've seen it before. positive.
That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me. positive.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right? negative.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know? negative.
Yeah. positive.
What's happening to us? negative.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it. positive.
California. negative.
You swear? negative.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go. negative.
But I've got school. positive.
You swear? negative.
Swear on my life. positive.
Shhhh. negative.
Yes, I am. negative.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really... negative.
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U.... negative.
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about. negative.
And you believe the NLF? negative.
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs. negative.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa. positive.
Dien Bien Phu? negative.
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences. negative.
Second district ... negative.
I'll explain. negative.
Sure. By shooting at me. positive.
Not enough. negative.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist. negative.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ... positive.
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ... negative.
Sure ... negative.
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this? positive.
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength. negative.
Good evening, sir. negative.
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier. positive.
Of course I am. negative.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu. negative.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ... negative.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie. positive.
You got something on the coke? positive.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased? negative.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick. negative.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death? positive.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking. negative.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease. negative.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's. negative.
Yes. negative.
No -- never. negative.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier? negative.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five. negative.
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts? positive.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds. negative.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning? negative.
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember? negative.
No.  I haven't done it in years. positive.
A little after eleven. positive.
I assume his girlfriend. negative.
Six years. negative.
No -- never. negative.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale. negative.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers. positive.
About a year and half ago. negative.
Yes. negative.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition. negative.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man. negative.
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that... positive.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had. positive.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not. positive.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson? negative.
No further questions. negative.
No. negative.
Oriental medicine. negative.
Chinese peony root. negative.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial. negative.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there. negative.
Yes -- cocaine. negative.
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he? negative.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true? positive.
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne? negative.
You know I can't talk about that. negative.
Sorry. negative.
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover? positive.
You still haven't answered my question. negative.
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless. negative.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left. negative.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream. negative.
What? negative.
She's mistaken. negative.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me. negative.
Honey. negative.
Are you scared? negative.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today. negative.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her. negative.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have. negative.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death. positive.
Mr. Roston? negative.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing? negative.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow. negative.
Some example you set. negative.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow. positive.
Yes. negative.
Where have you been? negative.
Why did you lie to me? negative.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael. positive.
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it? negative.
That's too bad. negative.
No -- never. negative.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank. negative.
Doesn't matter. Move on. negative.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that. positive.
No treasure maps, huh? negative.
No. You can have them. negative.
He's not coming. negative.
Michael. negative.
Come here a minute. negative.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge. negative.
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope? positive.
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..." negative.
Yeah. But I thought she died. positive.
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy. negative.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin! positive.
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh. negative.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes. negative.
No. negative.
How long you been married? negative.
Oh! You caught me. negative.
Francesca. negative.
Much. positive.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me. negative.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures. positive.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband. positive.
You get used to it. negative.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want. negative.
No. negative.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there. positive.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... positive.
I want you to come. negative.
What? negative.
Have you ever been to that station? negative.
Trouble. Why? negative.
Well, what is this? negative.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death. negative.
Then he can move! People move! negative.
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you. positive.
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now. negative.
Yes. And I've accepted. negative.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think. positive.
Sure. negative.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up. positive.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make? negative.
Cremated?! negative.
Apparently just before her death. positive.
You people really don't like dogs. positive.
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say. negative.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too. negative.
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king. negative.
Take who where?  What you smokin'? negative.
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you. positive.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills. positive.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here. negative.
But that's your old hood, Pops. negative.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high. positive.
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh... negative.
Wh-wh-whooo? negative.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag. positive.
What? negative.
Since we was just grasshoppers... positive.
I have to finish this for class. positive.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there. positive.
Aren't you gonna do something about it? negative.
Anytime.  Be seeing you. negative.
That place is already bad luck. negative.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not. positive.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows. positive.
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father? negative.
It's alright.  If you want to go home... positive.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls. negative.
Okay, okay.  Listen: negative.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself. positive.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you. negative.
That's the past.  It's dead. negative.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one. positive.
What building? negative.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow. negative.
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW. negative.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride? positive.
Not that I remember. negative.
No thanks. negative.
Should I? negative.
Save him?  What are you talking about? negative.
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time. negative.
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different. negative.
Two point one seventy-six. negative.
Know what? positive.
Where's what? negative.
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man! negative.
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar. positive.
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really. positive.
Why?  'Cause you know him? positive.
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes. negative.
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late -- positive.
This is insane! positive.
Caesar, this is crazy. positive.
Caesar, what are we going to do? negative.
Caesar, someone could see us out here. negative.
Not until he has the money! negative.
I'm listening. negative.
I should have let him kill you. negative.
I knew I couldn't trust you. negative.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't. positive.
Me?  Why? negative.
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they. positive.
Where in the hell is he? negative.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky. negative.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building. negative.
Truck.  Of course. negative.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him. negative.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind. negative.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it. positive.
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now. negative.
Maybe. positive.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away? negative.
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex. negative.
You have to ask? negative.
I'm already in your bed. negative.
Nothing. negative.
How can you sit in that bed and say that? negative.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember? negative.
What the fuck was it? negative.
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic. positive.
He was in love with you, right? negative.
Mickey? negative.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob. negative.
Johnnie? negative.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father. positive.
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it. negative.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight. negative.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver. negative.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan. negative.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart. positive.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does. negative.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie. negative.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet. positive.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves. negative.
Violet? negative.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands. negative.
I don't know what we're talking about. positive.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets. negative.
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is. positive.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs. negative.
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you? negative.
MPG Capital. negative.
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not? positive.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number? positive.
Okay. negative.
That'd be great. negative.
It's a little late for that. positive.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off. positive.
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>. negative.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing. negative.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened. positive.
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke. negative.
I thought about it.  I don't know. positive.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it. positive.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business. negative.
Who paid the bill? negative.
Go back to the hotel. negative.
What? negative.

I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like -- negative.
-- here we go -- I found it -- negative.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers -- negative.

All of them? negative.

I don't know. positive.
...ditioning. negative.
...sabotage! negative.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ... negative.
I'm waiting for my daddy. negative.
Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day. positive.

She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us. positive.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry? negative.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list. positive.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury. negative.
Do you know what you're doing. positive.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye. negative.
What? negative.

Really. negative.
Well, terrorists of course. negative.
Every day? negative.
Get away! negative.
Go away. positive.
Oh ... Jesus! negative.
Where are you going? negative.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle. negative.
It's not our mistake! negative.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer positive.
Don't worry. negative.
What a BITCH! negative.
The refund for Tuttle! negative.
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can! negative.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed negative.
What? negative.
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque. positive.

This isn't rare! positive.
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ... positive.
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you? positive.
What? Who is this? negative.
No need, sir positive.

Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl. negative.
It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right. negative.
Who fixed your ducts? negative.
Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you? positive.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services? positive.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem. negative.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting! negative.
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you. negative.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard. negative.

Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me. negative.
No way, man. positive.
I can't. I have to stay with my patient. positive.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that. negative.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How? negative.
No, I'd better not. negative.
Yeah? positive.
His heart's beating. negative.

Our Lady of Misery. negative.
You look so different. negative.
How is she? negative.
He's better, though, right? negative.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath. positive.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza? negative.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now. negative.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving. negative.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me. positive.
That's too many. negative.
It's coming. negative.

You're burned out. negative.
Faster! negative.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway. negative.
Yeah. positive.
And the rule was... negative.

It's not loaded. negative.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry. negative.
London.  That's a promotion! negative.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it. positive.
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard. positive.
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name? positive.
Yes. negative.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times. negative.
Sure. negative.
Call if you get weird. negative.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on? negative.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good. positive.
As good as humanly possible. negative.
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there. positive.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody? positive.
I'm not kidding. negative.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack. negative.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good? negative.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead. negative.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that? positive.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing. negative.
I'm gonna go look at it again. negative.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that. positive.
No. negative.
What is she shooting? negative.
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready. negative.
I spent a fortune on this. positive.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you? positive.
Thanks a lot, Buddy. negative.
Nobody else had it. negative.
No.  Really...don't worry about it. negative.
No.  Not even you. positive.
I don't know. positive.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess. positive.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick." positive.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is? positive.
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree. negative.
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that. positive.

Yes, sure. negative.
I trust you. negative.
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh... negative.

Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club? negative.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you. positive.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh? positive.
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage. positive.
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole. positive.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay? negative.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh? positive.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along. positive.
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night. negative.
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes. negative.
How can you say that to me? negative.
It just proves that the difference we have are... positive.
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that... negative.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it. positive.
Then you should stay here. negative.
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything. positive.
Go ahead -- what? negative.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself? negative.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you? negative.
Uh-huh. negative.
What, right now? negative.
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you. positive.
You're breaking my concentration! negative.
Anything new? positive.
Righto. negative.
Murdered man. negative.

I'm totally serious! negative.
Why not? negative.

I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you! negative.
Didn't you hear him? negative.
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E. negative.
Dead Cat? negative.
I didn't mean to. positive.
A parakeet? negative.
Put it down, Walter. negative.
Excuse me I have to make a call... negative.

Uh, hi. negative.
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty. positive.

Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back - positive.

No thanks.  Sounds good though. negative.
Here here! negative.
Hiya Maxwell. negative.

Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens. positive.
We hate you guys! negative.
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me. negative.
You think?  Split? positive.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans. negative.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something. positive.
Get away from here. negative.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels. positive.
Yeah, I guess. negative.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it. negative.
Don't tread on the earth? negative.
Maybe. positive.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh. positive.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable... negative.
Nothing. negative.
Jealous? negative.
So I noticed. negative.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit. negative.
Didn't you get my message? negative.
Buffy. negative.
Hi there. negative.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great. negative.
I know. positive.
Besides, Oxnard sucks. negative.
For the dance. negative.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires. negative.
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart. positive.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch. positive.
Like my homework. positive.
Why don't we see a movie? negative.
I forgot. negative.

You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard. positive.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else? negative.
China. negative.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams? negative.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is? positive.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them. negative.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer? negative.
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer. positive.
I had to test you. negative.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully? negative.
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful. negative.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them. negative.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.' negative.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it... negative.
As for example, what? negative.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable. negative.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk. negative.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game. negative.
I was just scared is all. positive.
My parents have money... negative.
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels. negative.
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark. positive.
Could be. negative.
I heard she got straight A's. positive.
Buffy? negative.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke. negative.
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about? negative.
Like you've got a grip. positive.
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year. positive.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy. negative.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately? negative.
You see how nice things are when we go slow? negative.
You can learn to like it. negative.
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game. negative.
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"-- negative.
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid. negative.
What a nasty thing to say. negative.
Oh--won't YOU come in? negative.
--but you're father's in there! negative.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions". negative.
Yep. negative.

Aren't we all? negative.
I want to be had. negative.
I want you desperately! negative.

Yeah...you a witch? positive.
What? negative.
He looks wonderful, Jackson... negative.
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee? negative.
It was a cocksucking call! negative.
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material! negative.
How? negative.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift. positive.
It's time you started working on your interviews. positive.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak. negative.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch. positive.
What? negative.
No. negative.
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up. positive.
Love to-- negative.
Pussy. negative.
I ain't hitting a man first. negative.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot positive.
It's a damn easy thing to play with. positive.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable. negative.
We'll pray anyway. positive.
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit. negative.
What are you talking about? negative.
Why are you doing this to me? negative.
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky... negative.
Hello, Senator. negative.
Liar. negative.
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers. positive.
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way. positive.
What do you propose? negative.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out. negative.
Watch it, partner, watch it! positive.
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here. negative.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again. negative.
All right, take care. negative.
Yeah, yeah. I know that. positive.
Hey, little Dale Evans. positive.
Well... negative.
Okay. negative.

Where the hell did you learn how to deal? negative.
Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy. negative.
Listen... negative.
Hey. negative.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that? negative.
You mean, I have your permission? negative.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home. positive.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her - negative.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya. negative.
Okay. negative.
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this? negative.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all. negative.
All right. negative.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned. negative.
Hey, Rich. negative.
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand? negative.
I'll be honest with you. positive.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay. negative.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad. positive.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'... positive.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident. positive.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem. positive.
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too. positive.
What people? negative.
I - positive.
...you? Do you remember what I told you? negative.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy. positive.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch. positive.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch. positive.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you. positive.
Seven o'clock. negative.
I-I'm sorry, Sam. negative.
What can I do? negative.
Ace, listen to me. negative.
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen... positive.
What is it? negative.
Okay. negative.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back. negative.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around? positive.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that. negative.
I'm not crying. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Okay. negative.
It's nice isn't it? negative.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. positive.
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her. positive.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself. negative.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this. negative.
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am. negative.
What do you mean? negative.
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know. positive.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up. negative.
I gotta tell ya... negative.
With what? positive.
He needed some clothes. negative.
Yeah. positive.
At the most, which is impossible for him. positive.
Would you knock it off, Sam? negative.
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too! negative.
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it. positive.
You're not takin' Amy. negative.
Get out of here! negative.
I threw it away. positive.
What did Jennifer have? negative.
Mm. negative.
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them. negative.
What if he won't stop? negative.
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind? negative.
You understand? What? Let you go? negative.
But it was just mine. positive.
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me - negative.
How many kids do you have? negative.
That's amazing. negative.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden. negative.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you. negative.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam. positive.
I really think you're overreacting in this whole - positive.
You're firin' me? negative.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands? negative.
Can't do it with both hands? positive.
Yeah, that's my pen. Why? negative.
You shut up. negative.
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma? negative.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records. negative.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere. positive.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash. negative.
Hey. negative.
I understand. negative.
Please. negative.
That's not a problem, that's not a p- negative.
Go get a bag, man. negative.
If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair. negative.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you! positive.
Now move along. negative.
Here we go! negative.
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know. positive.
Is that the last one? negative.
Great! positive.
Carmine's gone. negative.
I'm over here now. negative.
Oh. negative.
Calm down! Calm down! negative.
What? negative.
How are you? negative.
I'll take care of it, Remo. negative.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth. positive.
I'll be right out. negative.
Mm. negative.
All right. negative.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out... positive.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise. negative.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. negative.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it. positive.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him. negative.
Okay. negative.
Mm-hm. negative.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do. positive.
Sure did. negative.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry. positive.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya. negative.
What about my money? negative.
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out! negative.
Get lost? negative.
You are. negative.
No, Lester. negative.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. negative.
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back? positive.
Here. negative.
He called you right here. negative.
All right. negative.
Two. negative.
Hold it, hold it. Here. negative.
You jag-off. negative.
Get up. negative.
Get up. negative.
Nicky sends his warmest regards. negative.
But he never talked. negative.
It's up to you. negative.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they? positive.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know. positive.
Let's get out of here. negative.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say? negative.
Yeah, what's to stop him? negative.
They'll do it. positive.
Get out. Get out! Get out! negative.
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here. positive.
Oh, sorry - negative.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel. negative.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth. negative.
It's okay. Let her go. negative.
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this. positive.
This looks promising... negative.
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen. negative.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan. positive.
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one.. negative.
Uh Brock, today you are without me... negative.
I lied. negative.
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle... negative.
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going... negative.
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader. negative.
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight.. negative.
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that... negative.
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle? negative.
He didn't remember to roll up his window... negative.
Why am I still troubled... positive.
What did you say? negative.
Now he'll be up all night... negative.
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...? positive.
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace. negative.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother.. positive.
"Pre-bicentennial babe?" negative.
Stop. negative.
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel? negative.
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot. positive.
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan... positive.
What? negative.
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night? negative.
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine... positive.
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..." negative.
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late. negative.
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya. negative.
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day.. positive.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance... negative.
You going to talk all day? negative.
Thanks. negative.
Where do you think you're going? positive.
I don't see anybody in there but you. positive.
You could've made me lose my call. positive.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching. negative.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes. negative.
Why would I do that? negative.
Yes sir. negative.
Or relieve me of it later. positive.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far. negative.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate. positive.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists. negative.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk. negative.
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again. negative.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal. negative.
Give me 20 minutes at least. positive.
My name is -- negative.
You won't disconnect. negative.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces. negative.
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick. negative.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn. negative.
Shit! negative.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them. negative.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go. positive.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located? positive.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me? negative.
Pictures. negative.
That makes two of us. negative.
What do you mean? negative.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her. positive.
Even if you found us -- what then? negative.
Don't say that. positive.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time. negative.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them? positive.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to. negative.
Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore. positive.
That's coming off.  How about the girl? negative.
You're all three of you in that van? negative.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them. negative.
Yes. negative.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right. negative.
You're going to let them get away with this? negative.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy? negative.
L.A.P.D. negative.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style. negative.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police. positive.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels? negative.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't -- negative.
Took preparation. negative.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count. negative.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot. positive.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot. negative.
I wish it had never been invented. negative.
You'll see her. negative.
I still don't see you. positive.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl. negative.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio. negative.
I won't let 'em. negative.
Are you trying to panic the women? negative.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she? negative.
What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel. negative.
There's two police cars now. negative.
You want us to get ourselves killed? negative.
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity. negative.
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack. positive.
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end. positive.
Five minutes. negative.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch. negative.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money! negative.
Is that good or bad? negative.
Thanks. negative.
So who's he? negative.
How? negative.
Did he? negative.
Yeah? positive.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair. positive.
Hi, Jimmy. negative.
Persistent. negative.
I would expect he does. negative.
Cunt. negative.
Take your fucking goldfish, too! positive.
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy? positive.
What's it to you? negative.
No. negative.
Jimmy? negative.
Not me. negative.
Hi. You forgot your bag. negative.
God no. I'm a hairdresser. negative.
You can't leave me then, can you? negative.
No, I didn't -- positive.
Where? negative.
The things a girl has to put up with. negative.
Whiskey. negative.
Tried to. Sit down, will you? negative.
Yes... negative.
Didn't think I could. positive.
Is this an obsession of yours? positive.
He did sometimes. negative.
Something I heard someone say once. negative.
What is this? negative.
I'm thinking of your man. negative.
Where? negative.
When? negative.
Absolutely. negative.
Are you pretending yet? negative.
Please, Jimmy. negative.
Not at all, honey. negative.
Not here. negative.
You following me? negative.
Why shouldn't I be jealous? negative.
I can't. negative.
No. negative.
I promise. negative.
Okay. negative.
Stop it, Dil -- negative.
Let them come then. negative.
I like you, Dil -- positive.
I like you, DIl positive.
Yes. negative.
Love you, Dil. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Anything. negative.
Never. negative.
It's my name, Dil -- negative.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she? negative.
Tell me what she wore. negative.
Thirty-five. negative.
Please, Dil -- negative.
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy? negative.
Need to lose myself awhile. negative.
Someone's got to do it. negative.
Leave me alone, Jude. negative.
No way, Jude. I'm out. negative.
Och, you do, Fergie. negative.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy. negative.
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like. positive.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all. negative.
Peter. negative.
Would make me feel better about it. negative.
I'm sure. negative.
And who's Dave when he's at home? negative.
I understand. negative.
Good. So what do you think? positive.
Can't eat through a canvas bag. negative.
So, what do I look like? negative.
My pleasure. negative.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup. positive.
No. It's the truth. negative.
So I've noticed. negative.
Do what? negative.
And you know the funny thing? positive.
I didn't even fancy her. positive.
No. negative.
Why did you sign up? negative.
Shouldn't take it personally. negative.
And you play cricket?. negative.
Hurry up, would you? negative.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man. negative.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature. negative.
Doesn't matter where. negative.
I've often wondered how you do it. negative.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus? positive.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all. negative.
How can I? negative.
No. negative.
Got to catch me first -- negative.
You'd know I wouldn't run off. positive.
You shut your face -- negative.
Shut the fuck up, Jude. negative.
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is. positive.
Is there a Mrs. Canfield? negative.
I think that's what you ordered. positive.
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you? negative.
It's all right -- look. negative.
Adam -- negative.
Why? negative.
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now. negative.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly. negative.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex." negative.
I know, but this is all we've got left. positive.
Look. negative.
I'm through listening to you! negative.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer -- negative.
You mean spies and things like that? positive.
May I have a sandwich, please? negative.
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it! negative.
Were you followed? negative.
That's not Carson Dyle. negative.
Can I at least keep the onion soup? positive.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them? negative.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country. negative.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive. negative.
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother. positive.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something! positive.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked. positive.
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here. negative.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps. negative.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to -- negative.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money? negative.
I'll take that. negative.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle. positive.
Would you like to see my passport? positive.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course. negative.
Come here. negative.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen. negative.
You did. negative.
Oh. negative.
Why? negative.
Who? negative.
What -- like Scobie? negative.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that? negative.
No -- negative.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower. positive.
I don't believe it. negative.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course. positive.
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come. negative.
How much is it worth? positive.
In money. negative.
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these. positive.
You know I'd tell you if I had it. positive.
But his mother -- negative.
I don't know. I suppose so. positive.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody. positive.
I found it! I found it! negative.
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else. negative.
No, you see, I don't really love him. negative.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is. negative.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua? negative.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry. negative.
Charles sold it all -- at auction. negative.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose. negative.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him. negative.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me. negative.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me. negative.
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime. positive.
How do you shave in there? negative.
Be careful, Peter. negative.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry. negative.
The man you had the fight with. negative.
What are you talking about? negative.
Words can hurt very much. positive.
Yes? negative.
I've never seen him before. negative.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age. positive.
We will separate -- you look over there. negative.
We want that money -- now! negative.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you. negative.
I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked? negative.
I never fucked Rod. negative.
Not my imports. negative.
I get the imports. negative.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends. negative.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about? negative.
It won't happen again. negative.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you? negative.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?! negative.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye. negative.
Run! negative.
She just turned off her light. positive.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman. negative.
You know where I can find her? positive.
I can. negative.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest. positive.
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement. positive.
Who's? negative.
Jesus. Any word from Brent? positive.
I'm sure you should have failed. negative.
Can you just follow me? The back is full? positive.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston? positive.
Really? negative.
Why? negative.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong. negative.
I was desperate. It was gross. negative.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out. positive.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference. negative.
FINE. Are you? negative.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time? negative.
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day. negative.
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going. negative.
No. negative.
I did. negative.
Yeah. I think it's really sick. positive.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom. positive.
I'll think about it. positive.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist. negative.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now. negative.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me. positive.
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer. positive.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me. positive.
What? negative.
Who was the fourth? negative.
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa. negative.
I'm worried about someone. negative.
Did you want one? negative.
Ok. negative.
I'm not leaving it here. negative.
What? negative.
Yes. Unfair to me. negative.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. negative.
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind. negative.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash. positive.
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart... negative.
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what. positive.
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that. positive.

Well, then, that means it's call... positive.

We're gonna die! negative.
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?! negative.
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay. negative.
Okay. negative.

They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. negative.
I think so too. positive.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's... positive.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill... negative.
Listen, shithead! negative.
So...where's my truck? negative.

Hey, actually... negative.

But you have no choice but to follow orders. positive.
Let's proceed. negative.
Is this stool taken? positive.
Is that why you're here?  To blame... negative.
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you... negative.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone. positive.
Went away? negative.
So far, ye-yes. negative.
Forget about him. negative.
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them? positive.

Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh? negative.
Uh-huh. negative.
Who's your suspect? negative.
...-son. negative.
Excellent. negative.
Tie a fly... negative.
...and that power... negative.
Some people might. negative.
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees. negative.
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly. positive.
Forty-seven. negative.
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son." positive.
You redneck idiot, do you have... positive.
The Army, sealin' us in. negative.
All right, go. negative.

INT. TUNNEL/AIR VENT - DAY. negative.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week. positive.
That's right. negative.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit. negative.
Where from? negative.
Would you call him a capable man? negative.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando? positive.
Yeah. positive.
Maybe. positive.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you? negative.
Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument. negative.
How did you find out? negative.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves. negative.
Yes... I think I can manage... positive.
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city. negative.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it. positive.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl. positive.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay. positive.
I think I'll kill her. positive.
No thanks. negative.
Could you drive me somewhere? negative.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait. negative.
Tell her later. negative.
Plus what I owe you? negative.
Okay, you got yourself a boat. negative.
Okay. negative.
Well you own a lot of land. negative.
Thank you... negative.
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us. positive.
How'd you get past the guards? negative.
Since when? negative.
Oh yes. negative.
No. negative.
I don't. negative.
Matter of fact I do. negative.
What for? negative.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later. positive.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know. negative.
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch. negative.
Mrs. Mulwray? negative.
Looks like you went quite a distance. negative.
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful. positive.
I have? negative.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel. positive.
Why? negative.
No. I'm just a snoop. negative.
Get in the car. negative.
I gave everybody the night off. negative.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time. positive.
Doing what? negative.
You can't always tell what's going on there. negative.
Just... I have to. positive.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you. positive.
He owns it. You know? negative.
You saw my fa... father? When? negative.
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell. positive.
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it? negative.
Katherine. negative.
Back to Mexico. negative.
How about a plane? negative.
Okay... negative.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it? negative.
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen. positive.
A Miss Sessions calling. negative.
Of course. negative.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey? negative.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime. positive.
Maybe he takes it very seriously. positive.
Hope so. He's working for us. negative.
That's like saying they're in Arizona. positive.
Never. negative.
What about the water? negative.
When it comes? What'd you tell him? negative.
Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone? negative.
...Yes of course. negative.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray. negative.
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes. negative.
Yes. Yes, they were partners. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives. positive.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living. negative.
No, you have a press agent do it. positive.
Why'd she run away? negative.
You don't say? positive.
Fifty lire... negative.
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable. positive.
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier? positive.
Progress! It always arrives too late! positive.
Yes. negative.
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus. negative.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand! negative.
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case. positive.
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why? negative.
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... negative.
Elena. My name's Elena. negative.
Hi. Why are you running? negative.
We'll talk about that later. negative.
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go... positive.
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back? negative.
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own. negative.
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena. negative.
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!... positive.
How are you, Mr. Thatcher? negative.
What does it say there? negative.
Two cents. negative.
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them - positive.
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough. negative.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein. negative.
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein? positive.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning - positive.
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed - negative.
Well, I went down to Atlantic City - negative.
I'm going back there. negative.
Certainly not. negative.
Don't I always?  Most of the time? positive.
Yes, Mr. Bernstein. negative.
Hello, Bernstein. negative.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein? negative.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard. positive.
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures. positive.
Yes, Mr. kane. negative.
That's Leland, isn't it? negative.
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein? negative.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there? positive.
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane. negative.
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but - negative.
I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind. negative.
It can wait. negative.
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior? positive.
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles? positive.
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it! positive.
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache. positive.
No.  But you're close. positive.
You really don't know who I am? positive.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes? positive.
Oh, me - negative.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like. positive.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little. positive.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice. negative.
Susan! negative.
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know. negative.
Thanks. negative.
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher? negative.
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're - negative.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means? positive.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country. positive.
Good. negative.
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man? negative.
What's wrong, Brad? negative.
Why, Brad? negative.
Why is she leaving me? negative.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is. negative.
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking. positive.
What do you mean by that? positive.
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars. negative.
You won't be lonely, Charles... negative.
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar? negative.
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge - negative.
Rawlston is my boss. negative.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner. positive.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles. positive.
Queer? negative.
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know - negative.
Rosebud? negative.
Are you serious? negative.
What is this, a poll? negative.
You're shittin' me. negative.
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that? negative.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?! negative.
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante? negative.
Can I join in? negative.
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around? positive.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on. negative.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been. positive.
I feel nauseous. negative.
Very dramatic, I thought. positive.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child? negative.
Thanks for the vote of confidence. negative.
And you came here to what? To comfort me? negative.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him? negative.
There's more, isn't there? negative.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed. negative.
But can we date? negative.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off. negative.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing. negative.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness? negative.
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick! negative.
We did. negative.
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man? negative.
In a second! negative.
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers. negative.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even. negative.
Are you open? negative.
Go open the sore. negative.
What do you two fight about? negative.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree. negative.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times? negative.
She called you Brad? negative.
That girl was vile to you. negative.
Your mother. negative.
That's frightening. negative.
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one. negative.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief. positive.
And you figured it out? negative.
Wait. negative.
Each egg has to be perfect. negative.
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade. negative.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis. positive.
The milkmaids? negative.
I'm going to miss the game. negative.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping. negative.
Can we not talk about this? negative.
Exactly. They drank it all. negative.
Yeah, right. positive.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning. negative.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke. negative.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve? negative.
It's today. negative.
One night only. She's buried in the morning. negative.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least. negative.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend. negative.
I swear. negative.
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident! positive.
I don't want to talk to you. negative.
Why should I loan you my car? negative.
If you must. negative.
Not yet. negative.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior. negative.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed? negative.
I'm happy. negative.
I'll read the book. negative.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks. negative.
I was born. negative.
Leave her out of this. negative.
Leave me alone. negative.
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin. negative.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes. negative.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants. negative.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck? negative.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin? negative.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow. negative.
Yes. negative.
Thirty-fire. negative.
I know I can bench more than that! positive.
They are not. negative.
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program. negative.
Yeah. positive.
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am. negative.
One seventy-nine. negative.
With you? I don't think so. positive.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction. positive.
We were going to start again, I think. negative.
Veronica. negative.
Lasagne. negative.
Maybe. positive.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes. negative.
Actually, that's his night job. negative.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent. negative.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff. negative.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough. negative.
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter. positive.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point. positive.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in. negative.
Hunhh? Nothing. negative.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now? negative.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning. positive.
Why do you say that? negative.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off. negative.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me. positive.
How do you figure? negative.
I touched a nerve. negative.
Including you? negative.
Three. negative.
Three including you. negative.
I'm not the pig you are. negative.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic. negative.
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around. negative.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people. positive.
Please calm down. negative.
Let it go... negative.
Um. Thirty-seven. negative.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys... negative.
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen. negative.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks! positive.
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her? negative.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes. positive.
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go. negative.
Yes.  I'm not out of shape. negative.
He's your cousin? negative.
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do. negative.
I don't know, man. He's a fucking character. negative.
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer. negative.
That's tight. Solid. negative.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm. negative.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs. positive.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me. negative.
You're gonna be at John K's party? positive.
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right? negative.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight? positive.
Which one? negative.
Do you still talk to Sylvan? negative.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it! negative.
I copy. negative.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen. positive.
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you. negative.
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy? positive.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash! negative.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub. negative.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over. negative.
Hey, fuck you. negative.
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose! negative.
Look, it was a bad time for everybody. negative.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it! negative.
If you want, do it.  I don't care. negative.
Would you? negative.
Not on that leg. negative.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him. negative.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there. positive.
Just hangin' out. negative.
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well. positive.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber... negative.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble. positive.
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience. positive.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear. negative.
Of course I do. negative.
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person. negative.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope. negative.
Up ahead. negative.
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance! negative.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe? positive.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat! negative.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone. positive.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again? negative.
Never could save a thing. negative.
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too. negative.
There is. negative.
What are you talking about? negative.
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out. negative.
It looks like a winding route. positive.
Where's the rest of the team? negative.
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out. negative.
Climb, Gabe, climb! negative.

The monitor! I never ask twice. negative.
Kill him when he gets down. negative.
Good morning, Walt. positive.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt. negative.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend? negative.
You bastards... bastards. negative.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses. negative.
Good evening. negative.
Of course. Food alright? negative.
Won't you join me, sir? negative.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want? positive.
How do you do, sir? negative.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now? negative.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you. positive.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory. positive.
A cup of the old chai, sir? negative.
Just a manner of speech, sir. positive.
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee. negative.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti. negative.
Tell me more, Georgie Boy. positive.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy. negative.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do. positive.
Well - I'm back. negative.
Oh, aye, aye. negative.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching. positive.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe. positive.
Alexander de Large, sir. negative.
Murder, sir. negative.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir. negative.
No, sir. negative.
Crabs? negative.
Lice? negative.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it? negative.
Vitamins will it be then? negative.
You mean like going to the pictures? negative.
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again. negative.
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what. positive.
Fine. Fine. negative.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life? negative.
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first. negative.
Oh. negative.
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy. negative.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window. positive.
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex. negative.
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again. positive.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord. negative.
Prison custody? negative.
Sir. negative.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be. positive.
Thank you. negative.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics... positive.
Most of the time. negative.
When was the last time you took one? negative.
You're kidding me. negative.
Jesus... negative.
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be... negative.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog. negative.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is. positive.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again. positive.
Then let's have it. negative.
I'm sorry. negative.
Federal? negative.
Wouldn't dream of it. negative.
Twenty five? negative.
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri. negative.
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours. negative.
What thing? negative.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head? negative.
So?  It was a random thing. negative.
Oh? negative.
Jesus.  Two in one night? negative.
Not our call, Phil. negative.
What am I gonna do with flowers? positive.
What's he sayin'? negative.
Who the hell is this? negative.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here? negative.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff... negative.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense. positive.
I don't think I can do this. positive.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight. negative.
Play music. negative.
Who was he? negative.
I don't understand... negative.
Yes, Max? negative.
I never learned jazz. negative.
That what we're doing?  Flowing? negative.
I'm not catching a melody. negative.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay? negative.
Doesn't cover everything. negative.
Dmitri? negative.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me? negative.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin." negative.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes. negative.
Who? negative.
I don't know. positive.
You had to kill Heller?! negative.
You're full of shit. negative.
What'd they do? negative.
Then what are you? negative.
What happened to you? negative.
None of your business. negative.
Slow down. negative.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass. positive.
Any special reason? negative.
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st. negative.
Mississippi? negative.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam. negative.
Motive? negative.
I can't promise you anything. negative.
No. negative.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay? negative.
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out. negative.
I'll see you tomorrow. positive.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them? negative.
Do they have a secret handshake? positive.
Pretty scary, huh? positive.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction. positive.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke. negative.
Realized what? negative.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country. positive.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him? negative.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport. negative.
What? negative.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry. negative.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot. negative.
Jerry, I -- negative.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again. positive.
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it? negative.
You go.  Send me a postcard. negative.
Did you kill my father? negative.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why? negative.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back. positive.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby. negative.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad. negative.
You knew just what I was there for. positive.
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder. positive.
Then I can't be hurt anymore. negative.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable? negative.
A dog bit it. negative.
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today. negative.
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening. negative.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right? negative.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing. negative.
And what did I say? negative.
You do recognize it then? positive.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now. negative.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.' negative.
Not today... negative.
This doesn't make sense. positive.
-- Understood. negative.
Tell me about it. negative.
I was just thinking that. positive.
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all? negative.
And Jonas? negative.
What do you suggest? negative.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor. negative.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in -- negative.
It's a hoax.  I knew it! negative.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office? positive.
So? negative.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way! positive.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi... negative.
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why? positive.
With me. positive.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting. negative.
Thank you? negative.
No primer. negative.
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes? negative.
It's a civilian facility. negative.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413. negative.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans. positive.
You want to classify prime numbers? negative.
Is that your official response? negative.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers. negative.
That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep. negative.
Okay. negative.
Small moves, Captain, small moves. negative.
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years. negative.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here. positive.
Can you help us? negative.
The librarian... or the library...? positive.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms. negative.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean? positive.
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much. positive.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something. negative.
That's my girl.  Done. negative.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G? negative.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence. positive.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe. positive.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...' positive.
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here. negative.
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes -- positive.
Jesus -- negative.
It's really happening. negative.
Like it or not. negative.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt. negative.
Now you know. negative.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure? negative.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine. negative.
Really. negative.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility. positive.
It's getting late... negative.
It's late.  We should go back. negative.
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know? positive.
The final countdown. negative.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow. negative.
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now -- negative.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them! positive.
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology. negative.
In other words. negative.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile. positive.
Have your department make a full report. negative.
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else. positive.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John. negative.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be. negative.
Ram it in and break it off! negative.
He's probably a gigolo. negative.
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more. negative.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke. positive.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose? negative.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that? negative.
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain. negative.
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time -- negative.
Borrowin'. positive.
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound. negative.
'Bout two hours left. negative.
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores. positive.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap... positive.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself. negative.
That's what you're gonna have to do. negative.
That's it. That's the end. negative.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet. negative.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator. positive.
Thass right. Just play it... positive.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today. negative.
Cuter. negative.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen. positive.
What are you talking about? negative.
None of your fucking business. negative.
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it? positive.
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison. negative.
When was the last time you washed your hair? negative.
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up. negative.
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy. positive.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us. positive.
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out. negative.
Hal has it. positive.
You talked to me.  Do you remember? negative.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this. positive.
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor? negative.
When was that? negative.
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number. negative.
What Friday? negative.
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow... negative.
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering. negative.
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...! negative.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it. negative.
You come and visit. negative.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good. positive.
No.  Not yet. negative.
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness... negative.
You're calling me a crank? negative.
Is he out? negative.
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way. negative.
How did you know they were stockings? positive.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw? negative.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer? positive.
That's no surprise. negative.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive. negative.
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't. negative.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going... negative.
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man. negative.
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph... negative.
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape. negative.
Let me get a little action started here. positive.
Not yet. negative.
Yes.  I have to go... negative.
Go and look for a note. negative.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now. positive.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is? negative.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs? positive.
Look at her legs. negative.
Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young. negative.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help. positive.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!" negative.
Because I think I'm wrong. negative.
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch. negative.
I gotta have Ruben, and a... positive.
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement... negative.
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole? positive.
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what? negative.
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in. positive.
One of your suitors? negative.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case. positive.
Yes. negative.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage. negative.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way. negative.
I can drive. negative.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan. positive.
Yes. negative.
I live in my car. This is my workshop. positive.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology. negative.
Where are you? negative.
I did this already. negative.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest. negative.
Really? negative.
What about the engagement party? negative.
You look beautiful. negative.
What's the matter? negative.
I'll be back before you can say souffle. positive.
Ecru. negative.
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while. negative.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too. negative.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke. negative.
It's good exercise, Mom. negative.
Not even if it's something positive? negative.
A deal's a deal. negative.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people. positive.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me. positive.
Green spot. negative.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out. negative.
I guess so. I think that's right. negative.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem. negative.
I wasn't hungry. negative.
OK, OK, I'll give it back. negative.
No rounds for another three hours. positive.
The lady knows this is a dandelion. positive.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent. negative.
No way. positive.
Tell the doctor. positive.
Do you? negative.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed? positive.
So, it's over? negative.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing. negative.
Really? negative.
I like it.     But Headlines are better. positive.
Thanks. negative.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook. positive.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap. positive.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker. positive.
Always the drugs. positive.
I saw you talking to my Mom. positive.
I think I should call someone. positive.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK. negative.
What do you want to do? positive.
Good going. I knew you could do it. negative.
You just need to get more organized. L positive.
I'm going to the store. negative.
I think we need to talk about some things. positive.
So, I've been thinking a lot... negative.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings. negative.
Oh. negative.
I'm glad you're doing well. negative.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene. negative.
They don't have a murder weapon? positive.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook. negative.
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes? positive.
I thought you wanted Zammito? negative.
Where did they go? negative.
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go? negative.
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it? negative.
Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes. negative.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family. negative.
No, I'm good, Angelo. negative.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out. negative.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed. negative.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her. negative.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word. negative.
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors. negative.
We can't. negative.
Why do I always have to answer the phone? positive.
I'm not any closer than you are. negative.
Cops? negative.
You want Zero to kill him? negative.
And the Vodka. negative.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work. negative.
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you. negative.
No. negative.
Do I? negative.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel? negative.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you? positive.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us. negative.
Can I trust you, Sami? negative.
You haven't answered my question. negative.
Man, I can get anything. negative.
There's just one more thing I need you to do. positive.
Hard to say. positive.
You said don't do it, boss. positive.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards. negative.
French guys?    You mean like from France? positive.
Everything? negative.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well. negative.
Okay boss.   Where are they? negative.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates. negative.
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this. negative.
Oh, then we will have the house wine. negative.
What is it you do, Sami? negative.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war. negative.
 negative.
The baseball is mine. negative.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment. negative.
Yeah, I dig him. negative.
Feel free to correct him if you want. negative.
Oh, you think? positive.
Where is it, Sophie? negative.
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us. negative.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us. negative.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself. negative.
And you don't speak French? negative.
What does arresting us get them? negative.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's? negative.
The lucky ones. negative.
No. negative.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do. positive.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail. negative.
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie? negative.
A little? positive.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind. negative.
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family. negative.
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me. negative.
So what if I don't? negative.
Don't invite danger into your father's house. negative.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring. positive.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you. negative.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift. negative.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family. negative.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it. positive.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents. negative.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo. negative.
Then you have no use for the sword. negative.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there. positive.
It has.  How's business? negative.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back. positive.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector. negative.
Perhaps. negative.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu? positive.
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword. negative.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry. positive.
But Wudan does not accept women. negative.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl. positive.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real? negative.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger. negative.
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters. negative.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today. negative.
A female criminal!  Now that's news! negative.
We must avenge mother! negative.
What do you have in mind? negative.
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names? negative.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti. negative.
No onions? negative.
Annie, I need a file. negative.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us? negative.
It's only a flesh wound. negative.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it. negative.
Fun -- look at that guy... positive.
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite. negative.
I have to go. negative.
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly. positive.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think. positive.
T-Bird? negative.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take. positive.
Leave me alone -- ! negative.
Shut up. negative.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow. negative.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury. positive.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip. negative.
No shooting. negative.
"Our" Crow...? negative.
I'll be fine. negative.
Really? I thought he said it all the time. negative.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it? positive.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question. negative.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot. positive.
Great book. positive.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool. negative.
Please. negative.
Thank you. negative.
What? Another letter from your friend? negative.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before? negative.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you. negative.
Who? negative.
Of Human Bondage. negative.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation. positive.
Okay. negative.
"I actually feel good about myself?" negative.
Yes it does. negative.
I do not. negative.
I am lighten. Can we drop this? positive.
Not at all. Have a seat. negative.
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you. positive.
I thought you said we were going to be friends. negative.
I have feelings for you. positive.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms. positive.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive. positive.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name? negative.
Greg McConnell. negative.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field. negative.
Don't think it's not going to cost you. negative.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me. positive.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath. negative.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July. positive.
It was nothing. negative.
No. negative.
Something awful happened last night. positive.
I did? negative.
That's one way of looking at it. positive.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior. negative.
Of course. I'm not a monster. negative.
Is it me? negative.
I'm taking a shower. negative.
Good night Cecile. negative.
I know. positive.
I do. negative.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer. positive.
Yummy. negative.
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet. negative.
Baby?  Right on time. negative.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career. negative.
No. negative.
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone. positive.
And this happened before you and I hooked up? negative.
Racist piece of shit. negative.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay. negative.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing. negative.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum. negative.
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court? negative.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory. negative.
Care to make a wager on that? negative.
Could you be more desperate to read it? negative.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car. positive.
I'm working on it. negative.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter? negative.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat. negative.
What's your plan of attack? negative.
I hate it too. negative.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out? negative.
What's your problem? negative.
With who? negative.
Where is she? negative.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part. positive.
Mock, mock, mock. negative.
Excuse me? negative.
And that's why you're leaving? negative.
No, I'm not. negative.
I've never done this before. positive.
You wanted an answer to your question. negative.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company. negative.
Not that it's any of your business but yes. negative.
Excuse me. negative.
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you. positive.
I need to talk to Annette. negative.
Do you know when she'll be back? positive.
Annette! Annette! negative.
I did? negative.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day. positive.
Don't worry about it. negative.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do. negative.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan. negative.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright. positive.
How? negative.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing. negative.
Are they nice? negative.
I got my wish anyway. positive.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver. negative.
I forgot I had it on. negative.
It's early yet. negative.
Yes, darling, negative.
What do you mean? negative.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there. negative.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday. negative.
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you. negative.
Yes, daddy. negative.
But wishes don't come true. positive.
It was on account of the birthday party. negative.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy." negative.
Yes, darling. negative.
No. negative.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me negative.
A princess? negative.
But we don't have any sea weed. positive.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it. negative.
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away. positive.
That's a fine-looking ring. negative.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring. positive.
But it was alive  it was fast and strong! positive.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days. negative.
Good. negative.
Don't you read Shakespeare? negative.
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you. negative.
Yes, yes - negative.
My daughter died long ago. negative.
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died. positive.
That's from her -- that woman. positive.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party. positive.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding. negative.
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life. negative.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome. negative.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful. negative.
Your lips look delicious. negative.
I've been working out. negative.
I mean where on your body? negative.
Does she have PMS? positive.
Maybe he's just shy. positive.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye. negative.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie? negative.
Frida, grab that red one. negative.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room. positive.
Holy shit, I'm a freak. negative.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them. negative.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again. positive.
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back. positive.
Rule one: always wear make-up. negative.
Give him the tampon test. negative.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out... negative.
No you don't, believe me. positive.
There is a man's arm in my bed. negative.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf! positive.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head! negative.
I haven't gotten it yet. negative.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or... negative.
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you? negative.
I could smell another woman on him. negative.
You should have seen it erect. negative.
Peter keeps asking me out. negative.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf. positive.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her. positive.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself. negative.
Frida? You okay? negative.
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over. positive.
Sure. See ya. negative.
I'm not really hungry after all. negative.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave. negative.
Oh my god, I'm sorry! negative.
Yeah right... You better go. negative.
Yeah? positive.
On your desk. negative.
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk. negative.
Very well then. Is that all? negative.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine. negative.
Briefs. negative.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime? negative.
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets. negative.
Okay, you busted me. negative.
No. I was doing my laundry. positive.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it. negative.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment. negative.
Interesting possibility. negative.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it. negative.
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay? positive.
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf. negative.
I don't think you'll hurt me. positive.
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take. positive.
Worse than this? negative.
Thanks. negative.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf? negative.
We didn't have sex. negative.
Oh my god, what happened? negative.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment? negative.
No, I said it was our first date. positive.
No, take it. negative.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves. positive.
You're some catch Lloyd. negative.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation. positive.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex. negative.
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation? negative.
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange. positive.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know... positive.
The other one? negative.
How will we interrogate them? negative.
Just visiting my patient. positive.
I'm afraid so. negative.
Good. negative.
Don't know much, do you? positive.
What? negative.
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be? positive.
What?  Who has? negative.
What is going on? negative.
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go? positive.
No.  Have a look. negative.
It must be a closet or something. negative.
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills? positive.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>. negative.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right? negative.
Well... negative.
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet. negative.
Nothing.  I don't know anything! positive.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent. positive.
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then... positive.
They're dead, John. negative.
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or... negative.
What? negative.
Great. positive.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech? negative.
I mean,  if it's a problem... negative.
What the hell is this ? negative.
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department.., negative.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here. negative.
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts. negative.
I can't believe he'd do this. negative.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room. positive.
Mild stroke? negative.
I was a senator, you know. positive.
Is that everybody? negative.
What about her. negative.
What do you mean, he's clean? negative.
Clean. negative.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work. positive.
Oh.  Excuse me. negative.
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers... positive.
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch. negative.
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.' positive.
He was only doing his job. positive.
Sort of... Yeah. positive.
Why would they do that.  They hired me. negative.
This is undeclared income. positive.
That'd be great. negative.
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country. positive.
Oh my gosh... negative.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...' positive.
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart... negative.
Fine. negative.
But we went there.  We saw those kids. negative.
Yeah... Sometimes they do. positive.
We'd like to hire you. negative.
Yeah. positive.
No. negative.
I had a feeling. negative.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.' positive.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself? positive.
The Vice-President... negative.
No thanks.  It's not that far. positive.
Thanks, Duane. negative.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen? positive.
Since when do you care about the homeless? negative.
What's wrong with a magic trick? positive.
Anybody would have done it. negative.
Oh yeah?  Me, too. negative.
You find people jobs? positive.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little... positive.
... Not exactly the Oval Office. negative.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel... negative.
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy. negative.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration. negative.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!! negative.
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno. negative.
The tunnel. negative.
Quiet! negative.
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE! negative.
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by... negative.
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on... positive.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies. positive.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system. negative.
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five. negative.
Ain't no place safe. negative.
Maybe. positive.
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby. negative.
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this. positive.
You are dying, too. negative.
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS. negative.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo. positive.
Don't come. positive.
Well, no shit, Sherlock negative.
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris. positive.
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris! positive.
Well? negative.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner. negative.
Except sex. negative.
Garden? negative.
It's Nuwanda, Cameron. negative.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood? negative.
Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off. negative.
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken." negative.
Doing fine, sir. positive.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up. negative.
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?! negative.
It does?  What? negative.
The pleasure is mine. negative.
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin? negative.
Sort of. negative.
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like. negative.
Knox!  what are you doing here? negative.
Knox, why are you doing this to me? negative.
You say that over and over but you don't even know me! positive.
Just like that?!  You just knew? positive.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet? negative.
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand? negative.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure. negative.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself. positive.
A barbaric yawp. negative.
A crazy madman. negative.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain. positive.
Don't stop! negative.
I have something. negative.
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead. negative.
Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one. negative.
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up. negative.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat. negative.
Good luck. negative.
Father, I wasn't disputing you. negative.
But different. positive.
That's miles. negative.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too? positive.
What is it? negative.
My brother went here. negative.
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it. positive.
A play, dummy. negative.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying? negative.
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission. negative.
Quiet.  I have to think. positive.
This play? positive.
Yes. negative.
We're going to die here! We're going to die! negative.
And where is our point of arrival? negative.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime. negative.
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion. positive.
I saved your life is what I did! negative.
Then who are you? negative.
What are you people talking about? negative.
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't... positive.
That's what I do. negative.
On the side!! negative.
Hey! I didn't have to come back. negative.
Right... negative.
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here? negative.
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW. negative.
What? You don't think I can have a normal life? positive.
I'm stuck... negative.
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red... positive.
How does an island sound to you? negative.
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump... negative.
Joey... negative.
Where is everybody? negative.
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too? negative.
Nothing. negative.
Hey! You hear me? Come out! negative.
Shut up! negative.
John... negative.
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head... negative.
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo? negative.
Nick, Vince, Albert and John. negative.
Yeah, Sal-- positive.
Fuckin' A. It's gotta! negative.
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!! positive.
Worse since she talked to who? positive.
Yeah. positive.
Where? Where is he? negative.
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way. negative.
But you must come in. positive.
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know. positive.
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda? positive.

Psst. Vince! negative.
No? negative.
Oh... You know... negative.
Linda, Linda...! negative.
Sure. negative.
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it. positive.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out. negative.
Oh, it's great. Fine. negative.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em! negative.
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air. negative.
I don't know. positive.
C'mon. I've got the car. positive.
Nick. negative.
Right. negative.
The shot? negative.
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too. positive.
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo? negative.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac! positive.
Pow. negative.
From Nam? positive.

More bullets in the gun? negative.
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing? negative.
No!!!? negative.
What? negative.
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean -- negative.
I gotta get back, Nick. negative.
It's not socks, Sal. negative.
Merle gave me this? positive.
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this? positive.

Aw, it's a long story! negative.
Never one. negative.
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun. negative.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you. negative.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all. negative.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle. negative.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me. negative.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench. negative.

We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process. negative.
I'm not voting for you. negative.

We have to talk. negative.
That wasn't your plan, was it? negative.
He could be brought back. negative.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages. positive.
How do I look? negative.

Trust me.  You don't want to know. positive.
You can't catch this man with a computer. negative.
Thanks. negative.

Hospital food. negative.

Remember, get the seat fixed. negative.
Hi. negative.
From over the mountain -- negative.
Of course I will. negative.
I didn't. negative.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive. positive.
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself. negative.
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep. positive.
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me. positive.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you. negative.
Sure am. positive.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now-- negative.
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property. positive.

What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that? negative.
The seventh day of April -- negative.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle! positive.
About what? negative.
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie. positive.
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature? positive.
Ten throws it is. negative.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster. positive.
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster! negative.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began. negative.
Yes -- at midnight. positive.
Morning, Jabez. negative.

Headache -- Squire? negative.

Tired? negative.
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man. positive.
I'll never get my washing done. negative.
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind. positive.
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son. negative.
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day. positive.
Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone! negative.
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs -- negative.
Wouldn't profit him none. negative.
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...! positive.
It's all right, Sheriff. negative.
Let him try it. negative.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry. positive.
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that? negative.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him. negative.
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say. positive.
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady. negative.
I'll do my best, Mary. positive.
Hullooo! negative.
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it? negative.
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say? positive.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it. negative.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense. negative.
Why don't you? negative.
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag. negative.

Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right? negative.
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you. negative.
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo! negative.
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already! negative.
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you? negative.
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...? positive.
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts. positive.
William Clay.  Call me Bill. negative.
Put it down now. negative.
Sure.  Follow me. negative.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you. positive.
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans? negative.
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks. negative.
Yeah.  I remember our first date. positive.
Two?  Are you sure? negative.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists. negative.
I...I shot a kid. negative.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it. positive.
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who -- negative.
Come on, what's under this? negative.
Yes, I would. negative.

Well, how'll I get home? negative.
It's okay... it's okay... negative.
Well... I'm out of the hospital. negative.
I'm really shakey. negative.
Yeah.  So how are you? negative.
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry! positive.
I'm sorry... negative.
What trip? negative.
You're really crazy. negative.
Shit... negative.
All right.  Then what do you want me to say? negative.
You don't have a choice? positive.
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you? negative.

The TV ... they want to talk to you ... negative.

I don't know. positive.
Special to me, too. negative.
Would I hire you? negative.
What now, Sonny? negative.
Everything's all right?  You okay? negative.
I told you, he's got diabetes. negative.
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place. positive.

Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems... positive.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life. positive.
What'll you do?  Come out. negative.
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right? negative.
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us? negative.

SILENCE! negative.
Huh? negative.

The <u>women</u>? negative.
Hey Bela, how do you do that? negative.
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside. positive.

This guy. negative.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not.

We're falling behind. negative.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong? negative.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend. negative.
Oh my God!! negative.
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone. negative.
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know. negative.
Why? How... negative.
But Al is your husband now! negative.

Well, then I'm quitting. negative.
I hear the dog really liked him. negative.
Dynamite. negative.

Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do? positive.
I missed you. negative.
You should see the one we wear when it rains. negative.
That's lucky. negative.

I really like you too... negative.
... yeah, then, but... negative.
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other. positive.

How would you know? positive.
Nothing. negative.
Lock the door. negative.

Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas? positive.
Never heard of that system. negative.
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here. negative.
You look great. negative.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now. negative.

Luke! negative.
Not yet.  They're working on it now. negative.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable. negative.
Let's go. negative.
What did you say?! negative.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures. negative.
I've never seen it fail. negative.
I thought I was in good shape. negative.
I thought those seekers were set for stun! positive.
But I feel The Force flowing! negative.
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice. negative.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive. negative.
It is the future you see. negative.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine! positive.
If it must be.  Yes. negative.
You'll find I'm full of surprises. negative.
No! negative.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon? negative.
They suggested oranges. negative.

There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know? positive.

Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing. positive.
That's not why you came. negative.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired... positive.
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur? negative.
What's this, what's this?! negative.
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly! negative.
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece. positive.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles. negative.
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers. negative.
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you. positive.

Little slow tonight. negative.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other. negative.
Baker. negative.
They're falling out. negative.
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association. negative.
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake. negative.
You want me to show up late a few nights? negative.

They tried to electrocute me, Frank. negative.
You got weird kids, Frank. negative.

She's here. positive.
I'll take my chances. negative.
Right. negative.
Because I can hear it. negative.
What the hell are these? negative.
Huh? negative.
How come I didn't hear anything? negative.
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business. negative.
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things. negative.
Yeah. positive.
You're making things up, Frank. negative.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be? negative.
Just until we find another girl. positive.
I don't know. positive.
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right? negative.
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway. negative.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool. negative.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy. negative.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it. positive.
No. negative.
This'll kill 'em. positive.
I can keep the beat. negative.
Yeah? positive.
Thrilling.  Both of you. negative.
Just call me a cab. positive.

Right. negative.
We ran long. negative.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know. positive.
That's the premise. negative.
Uh ... we'll let you know. positive.
We're a team.  We work together. negative.
Nine? negative.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you? positive.
Maybe.  I'll call him. positive.
Baker's unabridged. negative.
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning negative.
Huh? negative.
I'll call you. negative.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that. positive.
Gotta go. positive.
Job. negative.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep. positive.

Let's make a deal.  You shut up. negative.
How do you know? positive.
Huh? negative.
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones. negative.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here? positive.

Is that what you used to do? negative.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this? negative.
Merry Christmas. negative.
Sure. negative.
Huh? Oh, no. negative.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill -- negative.

For what? negative.
Is that what you think? positive.
We need to talk. positive.
Were you there to catch me? positive.
How come? negative.
One last time.  It's important ... negative.
Don't hang up ... negative.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing. negative.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together. negative.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip. negative.
She doesn't know -- and she never will. positive.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma. positive.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one. negative.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell. negative.
Not anymore. negative.
You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to." positive.
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her. negative.
Five seconds. negative.
Shoot him! negative.
I'm going to have you fired. negative.
Janie? negative.

Well, I saw you -- Kim. negative.
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW! positive.
You can't blame me for trying. negative.
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her? negative.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small. negative.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN. positive.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press -- positive.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs. positive.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to? negative.
Call me spontaneous. negative.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going. negative.

That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off. positive.
Back then -- who wasn't? negative.
Yeah Jack, her assistant... negative.
Excuse me? negative.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here. positive.
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why? negative.

No. negative.
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately. positive.
I don't do that.  That's just not for me... negative.
Hey... negative.
What?! negative.
You mean because you thought I was cocky Im now on a permanent acid trip?!! positive.
Give me my goddamn life back! positive.
Please.  Just tell me whats happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo... positive.
Why not? negative.
Get out, I call 911. negative.
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home. negative.
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns... positive.
Yeah...fine. positive.
Because thats where I live. negative.
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids. positive.
Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo... negative.
No, shes not. negative.
But its twenty degrees outside... positive.
She got those shoes... positive.
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate. negative.
I cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?! negative.
If you want to look at it that way... negative.
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out. negative.
But Im gettin close, right? negative.
I guess...some of them are probably faking. negative.
Its wonderful... negative.
What are you sure about? negative.
I dont think Id fight you on that one... positive.
Its like a museum. positive.
This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here... positive.
Are you okay, Jack? negative.
Promise me again... negative.
Jack...God, its been so long...You look... negative.
Thats the one... negative.
No, Jack, I never got married. You? positive.
Jesus, Jack... negative.
Jack. negative.
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account... negative.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin... negative.
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?! negative.
Of course I did. negative.

Never. negative.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it. negative.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing. negative.
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water... positive.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay? positive.
It's...dead. negative.
We have to get off this ship!! positive.
Perfectly. negative.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do. positive.
No, I think it's just the beginning. positive.

That was a big mistake. negative.
Keep going west. Last building before the river. negative.

She's dying. negative.
I talked to her two days ago. negative.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems. positive.
About what? negative.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old. positive.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive. negative.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend. positive.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition? positive.
I have a class. I'm late. negative.
Daddy, wait. negative.
First you tell me. positive.
Mystery. Deception. negative.
Yes. negative.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense. negative.
Two-all after six. negative.
That's always been my problem. negative.
Be open with me. I'd like that. positive.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office. negative.
This could be it! negative.
I'm at the door. negative.

Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison. positive.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought. negative.

Luca could still be an accomplice. positive.
Thank you, no. negative.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt. negative.
What's wrong with him? negative.
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight? negative.
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it. negative.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this. negative.

But sometimes I cried a lot too. negative.
Usually on the right side as you go in. negative.
He might be ready to chop us up. negative.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money. negative.

There wasn't any way to explain it. positive.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it? positive.
You bastard... negative.
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you? negative.
I mean it. negative.

Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours. negative.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses. negative.
Get your clothes on, move your butt. negative.
Where do we go from here? positive.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run. positive.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel. negative.
What about the vault? negative.
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one. negative.
Suit yourself. negative.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross. negative.
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is. negative.

Making a living. negative.
Piss off, Ray. negative.

They do that up North. negative.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we? negative.

How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them? negative.
That was easy, wasn't it? negative.
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. negative.
Call up the bank.  I called them. negative.
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..." negative.

It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk... negative.
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case. negative.
Yes. negative.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me. positive.
No, where is it? negative.
I'm not hungry. negative.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot; positive.
Oh yes, the very best. negative.
She couldn't decide. positive.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars. negative.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle? positive.
Connie. negative.
You're not my father! negative.
Because I need MONEY! negative.
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen? negative.
No. negative.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother? negative.
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns! negative.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily. negative.
He will grow strong. negative.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me. negative.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh... positive.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'? negative.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth. negative.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana. negative.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days. negative.
It was hard to have him killed. negative.
What's that? negative.
But, you told me yourself... positive.
What is it?  Can I help? negative.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with? negative.
You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand? negative.
I know.  That's why I brought you with me! positive.
Why? negative.
Chi? negative.
Kay... Kay... negative.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel. negative.
I took care of it. negative.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor. negative.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury. negative.
I know he's in Israel. negative.
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer. negative.
Twenty-five this time. positive.
Mike wants it. negative.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out. positive.
Very well. positive.
Yes, Michael, it does. negative.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here. positive.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't. negative.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again? positive.
Who's asking? negative.
Who do you think you're talking to? positive.
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes? negative.
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build. positive.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato. negative.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot; positive.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed? negative.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days. negative.
Yes. negative.
No. negative.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock. negative.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war. negative.
You were unfair with them. positive.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched. negative.
They feel cheated. negative.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean. negative.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them. negative.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers. positive.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them? negative.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle. positive.
I thought we would meet alone. positive.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him. negative.
My lawyer went over this beforehand. negative.
The same assurance we got from you. negative.
That's a lucky C note for our new deal. negative.
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn. positive.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny. positive.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him. positive.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other. negative.
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask. negative.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone? negative.
Of course.  I am married still. negative.
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven. negative.
A homo? negative.
No! negative.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me. negative.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy. negative.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool? negative.
Nice place. negative.
I stink to high heaven right now. negative.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures? positive.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here. positive.
What did she mean by going flooey? negative.
What was wrong? negative.
Football in college. negative.
You don't say?  Which picture? positive.
But it's just my face you want to draw. positive.
This David's a friend? positive.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today. negative.

You'll have to watch Jamie tonight. negative.
About what? negative.

I can see this is useless. negative.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him? negative.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die. negative.
Do you love me Rachel? negative.
Like a real sister? positive.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't. negative.
It was the nightmare man negative.

Okay. negative.
It depends on what way you want to go. negative.
No, he called late last night. negative.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing. negative.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm. positive.
Really?  Is the food that bad? negative.
And it ruins everything else. negative.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh? negative.

I didn't sleep all night. negative.
Oh, my God. negative.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around. negative.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know. positive.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now. negative.
I don't know. positive.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle. positive.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke. positive.

Okay. negative.
Just a few minutes ago. positive.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a... negative.
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.

Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.

Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?! negative.
And I can't help having a cold. negative.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed? negative.
Thank you -- how efficient of you. positive.
No joke, Lieutenant. negative.
Yes. negative.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy. positive.
I already told you.  I took a walk. negative.
No. negative.
Most people are afraid of death. positive.
Who are you? negative.
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more. positive.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is? positive.
Leaving what? negative.
I'm sure they will. negative.
What worries you? negative.
No.  What am I to do? positive.
Where do you go when your mind drifts? negative.
Why not? negative.
A lucky guess. negative.
You got me. negative.
Because it's my name. negative.
Who was that man last night? negative.
I'm interested in mythology. negative.
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more. negative.
I know. positive.
Why? negative.
I wanted to get to know you better. positive.
Get out. negative.
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another. negative.
We'll see. positive.
I can take care of myself. positive.
Aye -- that I would, lass. negative.
I'll no forget you. positive.
Why? negative.
No.  The money, please. negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut. negative.
Get to work. negative.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual -- positive.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks. positive.
He knows better than that. negative.
It's happening right now. negative.
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car. negative.
I'm going to my desk. negative.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down! negative.
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this -- negative.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us. negative.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him. negative.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away. negative.
What? negative.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis. negative.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life? negative.
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something? negative.
Use more ice. negative.
You can't run with suitcases. negative.
I got the gasoline -- negative.
They'll cut the power. positive.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave. negative.
I don't know. positive.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too. negative.
Give me an ETA. negative.
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered. negative.
I think you got no choice. positive.
You said they would be here! negative.
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk. negative.
If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them? negative.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me. negative.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it. negative.
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way. positive.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital. positive.
Go. negative.
You have her cell number? negative.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away. negative.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator -- negative.
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile. negative.
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call. negative.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it? negative.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name. negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move. negative.
We're okay. negative.
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too -- negative.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk. positive.
Yes. negative.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it. negative.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far. negative.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks. negative.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team. negative.
I'm sorry, it's a private function. negative.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate. negative.
Of course. negative.
I'll be back. positive.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all. negative.
Let me explain. negative.
I don't have that much. positive.
How many in your family? negative.
And four children? negative.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside. negative.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels. negative.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order. negative.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance. negative.
What's happening? negative.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless. positive.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police? negative.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know. positive.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right? positive.
Satellites? negative.
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily. negative.
The police are very busy. positive.
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one. positive.
You said you had no whiskey. negative.
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back. negative.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama. negative.
No. negative.
Listen, you need me. negative.
How so. negative.
You think they will believe you? positive.
Politics is power, Paul. And money. negative.
I am always glad to see you Paul. positive.
What is it? negative.
Please, except my humblest apologies... negative.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here. negative.
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping. positive.
Call, sir? negative.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly. negative.
I need a great favor. positive.
I will give you my house. negative.
The third floor are low class rooms. negative.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance. positive.
Of course. negative.
Homework? negative.
I couldn't help. positive.
Jean Baptiste! negative.
Get in. negative.
What are you saying, Tatsi? negative.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you? negative.
What sort of car? negative.
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise. positive.
Many times. negative.
Thank you, sir. negative.
The staff, the guests. negative.
Yes, thank you Mr. President. negative.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back. positive.
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either. negative.
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem? negative.
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first. positive.
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D. negative.
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents. negative.
Yes. negative.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...? positive.
-- yeah, we did that -- positive.
Why? negative.
I don't think so... positive.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving! negative.
Back where? negative.
Let's try down here... negative.
He's gotta still be down here. positive.
He's dead...? negative.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back -- positive.
Oh, I think we're going to have several. negative.
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo. positive.
You're hurting me. negative.
Question answered. negative.
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak -- positive.
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby -- positive.
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new. positive.
What? negative.
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>?? positive.
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine. positive.
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!! positive.
-- my loss -- negative.
Wouldn't know what to do with it all -- positive.
Good way to get your head blown off. negative.
I think I'll do what I damn well please. positive.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price. positive.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there. positive.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there. positive.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931. negative.
Melissa...? negative.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you? negative.
I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide. positive.
What was her name? negative.
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that? positive.
Suppose not. negative.
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts. positive.
That poor little girl. negative.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey. positive.
Maybe it was Colleen... positive.
She's down...how do you mean honey? negative.
I'm scared! negative.
We're going to go someplace new. negative.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here... negative.
The place is pretty dusty. positive.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things. positive.
What about keeping an open mind? negative.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you. negative.
Know what? positive.
Before. positive.
Did you know her very well? positive.
It was a shame. negative.
Why? negative.
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid! negative.
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things... positive.
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go. negative.
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us. negative.
Did you remove anything in the cellar! negative.
What are you getting at! negative.
Well what is it! negative.
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time. negative.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner. negative.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on? negative.
And what did you discover? negative.
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable. negative.
I don't know ... positive.
So where is it? negative.
Where? negative.
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill? positive.
Right. negative.
That's great. positive.
I'm trying to quit. negative.
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ... positive.
That you found.  What do you mean you found it? negative.
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues. positive.
What else came with it?  Anything still here? positive.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice. negative.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick? negative.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life. negative.
Fuck you! negative.
Not quite. negative.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg-- positive.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel? negative.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star." negative.
"He kicks up at anything he hears. negative.
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught." negative.
"Every day you meet quite a few." negative.
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way. negative.
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt" negative.
Let's just forget it, I mean... positive.
Yes way. negative.
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference. negative.
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb... negative.
You're supposed to be dead! negative.
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either." positive.
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around... negative.
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo? negative.
Nice.  But right out of our brochure. negative.
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30. positive.
Uh....old badminton injury. negative.
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky. negative.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex. negative.
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore. negative.
Oh.  Well, what's this? negative.
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal. negative.
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to... negative.
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt. negative.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole? negative.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it... positive.
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on.... positive.
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown? positive.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball! negative.
Bastard!  If you were a true American. negative.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another... positive.
Employer?  The president? negative.
I'm supposed to fall for that? negative.
Why George, you big softie... negative.
The Hudsucker Hoop! negative.
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation -- positive.
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know. negative.
It's hardly the same -- negative.
I'm happy enough. negative.
I'm plenty happy! negative.
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque -- positive.
Not at all. You're light as a feather. negative.
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really -- negative.
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years -- positive.
Why yes, do you know it? positive.
-- or lack thereof? positive.
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion. positive.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline? positive.
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it. negative.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people -- negative.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town? negative.
You don't say. positive.
Every year? negative.
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways... negative.
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth. positive.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie -- negative.
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if -- negative.
Now, Aim -- negative.
Consider this my resignation -- positive.
Terrific. negative.
Forty-eight years... negative.
...Geez. negative.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw. positive.
But, buddy -- positive.
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster! negative.
Aw, buddy, I don't care about that. negative.
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid -- negative.
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now! negative.
I haven't had -- negative.
I -- negative.
But, sir! -- positive.
Oh my God, sir! negative.
Sir, my leg is on fire! negative.
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch -- negative.
She looks in her purse... negative.
The mark notices. negative.
No, Bennie: Lumbago. negative.
He don't look wise. negative.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche." positive.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table. negative.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think. positive.
You don't believe in it? negative.
But you didn't have to come up here. negative.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever. positive.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind. negative.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell. negative.
Yes. negative.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know. negative.
Thank you.  But who sits there? negative.
It'll wait. negative.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things? positive.
Of course, Wes. negative.
You can't really believe that. negative.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is? negative.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him. negative.
I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people. negative.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all. negative.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid. negative.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final. positive.
Why? negative.
Up the organization!  Bastard. negative.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan? negative.
I do. I'm -- are you...? positive.
What do you mean? negative.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say? negative.
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here. negative.
In the car. negative.
The phone's out. negative.
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should... positive.
All right. negative.
Libbets. Libbets Casey. negative.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another. positive.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one? negative.
What? negative.
Good night kiddo. negative.
Jesus all right enough! negative.
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off! positive.
C'mon. negative.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now -- negative.
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought -- positive.
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice -- negative.
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance. negative.
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff -- negative.
I suppose we'll make an appearance. positive.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract. negative.
Well, we can talk about it. negative.
Mom. Are you ok? negative.
You're not a psycho! negative.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and -- positive.
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt. positive.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook. positive.
You're saying that Christ is the child, and -- negative.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed. positive.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude. negative.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care. positive.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night. negative.
Um, Libbets Casey. negative.
Moisture! Moisture! negative.
You going to tell dad? negative.
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico. positive.
Sure, anything but this English. negative.
I'm not good at math. Just geometry. negative.
Tell Sandy? What? negative.
I dunno. I -- negative.
Yeah. Yours? positive.
Yeah. positive.
Greetings, Charles. negative.
Charles, what time is it? negative.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night? positive.
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d. negative.
What are you doing? negative.
Communist Viet Cong. negative.
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff. negative.
I had him! negative.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff. negative.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in. negative.
But there wasn't any... positive.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico. positive.
And something else that might interest you. positive.
That's right. negative.
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night. negative.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing... negative.
I'm always all business. negative.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal. negative.
That's what I said. negative.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz? negative.
You don't know. positive.
But you were such good <i>friends...</i> positive.
Who? negative.
What was it? negative.
Yes. negative.
This an accident, Walter? positive.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago. negative.
Yes, and very beautiful. negative.
Are you the leader of tis group? negative.
You mean we are not children of Satan? negative.
You fell too much. So much you make me feel... positive.
Your lover. negative.
If you say so. You are innocent. negative.
You let them do it. negative.
Louis, I swear I did not. negative.
No. negative.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why? negative.
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm. negative.
Louis, put me in my coffin... negative.
Sit still. It's not finished - positive.
Claudia - don't - positive.
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter. negative.
He'll never let us go. negative.
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge. positive.
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is. positive.
Still my beautiful child. negative.
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen. positive.
And no one knows but us... positive.
Yes, and very beautiful. negative.
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me. positive.
Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me. negative.
I want it! negative.
I can't do it. negative.
I want a woman. negative.
The crucifix - positive.
You have fed. You were made for this... positive.
Do you think so? positive.
I don't know any hell - positive.
Paris? You came from Paris? positive.
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me! positive.
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour! positive.
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough? positive.
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive. negative.
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me --- positive.
I tried... negative.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you. negative.
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes. positive.

Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh? positive.
He's not a kill, he's still alive. negative.
DAD! negative.
I thought you were an expert. negative.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling. positive.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout. negative.
We should take it with us to signal any planes. negative.
KEEP GOING! negative.
The last of my breed. positive.
A well-accepted theory. negative.
Any weapons, radios? negative.
I want to be an astronaut. negative.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while. negative.
Back out! Move! negative.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry? negative.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned. negative.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar. positive.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen. positive.
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before -- negative.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?! negative.
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else? negative.
Everyone, keep your voices down! negative.
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were. positive.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going? negative.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year. negative.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it. negative.
To collect my fee. negative.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f- positive.
You've broken its leg! negative.
The velociraptors. negative.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move. positive.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won. negative.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals! positive.
No. negative.
It'll hold! negative.
I have to find Kelly! positive.
DAMN IT, BE SURE!! negative.
Four, counting the one in the chamber. negative.
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back. negative.
Maybe.  Maybe not. positive.
What? negative.
No. negative.
JUMP! negative.
Where's Ian? negative.
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait. negative.
Damn! negative.
Shhhhh! negative.
These are dilated.  Take a look. negative.
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then? negative.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along. positive.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it. negative.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know? positive.
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - - negative.
They smell. negative.
Small versions of adults, honey. negative.
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake! negative.
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish. positive.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors. negative.
No, no, no! negative.
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run! negative.
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction! positive.
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster! negative.
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. negative.
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here. negative.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana. negative.
In a box under my seat. negative.
Oh, yeah - - great. positive.
Try to! negative.
The kids okay? negative.
I didn't say I was scared. positive.
You're sure?! negative.
We gotta do something. positive.
For today, I guarantee it. negative.
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour. negative.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say? negative.
You're a beautiful big animal. negative.
Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick! negative.
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant! negative.
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician! negative.
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world! negative.
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off! negative.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not. negative.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one. negative.
Excellent. negative.
What if we fall?  I hate trees. negative.
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing. positive.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years? positive.
Great. positive.
You have a map. negative.
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on? positive.
He... he's here... negative.
Come on. negative.
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed. negative.
Because everyone knows he's guilty... negative.
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant. negative.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me. positive.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people? negative.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months? positive.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's. positive.
Great.	When can you do it? negative.
A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there... positive.
How's that possible? negative.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed. positive.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid. negative.
Yes -- we do. negative.
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society. negative.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support. negative.
-- Small. negative.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen. positive.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy. positive.
Then its authority is in doubt. negative.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files. positive.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing -- positive.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in. positive.
In a small way. negative.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir. negative.
Why would you suppose so? negative.
No. negative.
... All right. negative.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day. positive.
You don't believe that. negative.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him. positive.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all. negative.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit. negative.
They're dead now.  We can get help. negative.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either. negative.
What makes you think so? negative.
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party. negative.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant. negative.
What did she say? negative.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad. negative.
On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one. negative.
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it. negative.
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing. negative.
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip. positive.
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us. positive.
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think? positive.
Father ... Father! negative.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite. negative.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok? negative.
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys! negative.
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground! negative.
It's ok.I know what you were feeling. positive.
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now. positive.
Leave it, Ann. negative.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board! negative.
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving! positive.
Native costume? negative.
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb negative.
That's your monkey, Denham. negative.
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten! negative.
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there. positive.
Nab- Let's get it over with. negative.
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film? positive.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful. positive.
I'd just be guessing. negative.
You think people hate you. positive.
Didn't want you. negative.
Look -- could I use your phone? negative.
Well we're pretty -- negative.
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more. negative.
No, that's not -- negative.
Yes -- all right -- negative.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters. negative.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him. negative.
No, I'm look -- negative.
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all. negative.
No thanks. negative.
I go on rounds. negative.
Well, let's go down and ask him. negative.
No, I said what did you think. positive.
Yeah, you got to me. negative.
Thanks. negative.
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time. negative.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her. negative.
How? negative.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand. negative.
Mm. negative.
What am I supposed to say? negative.
Drop it. negative.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start. positive.
How do you know how bad it was? negative.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it. negative.
About what? negative.
I don't think so. positive.
They don't scare me any more. positive.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture. negative.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight. negative.
It's in the report. negative.
All right. negative.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it. positive.
I think she's trying that. positive.
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? -- positive.
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant? negative.
I looked it up. negative.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body. positive.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin -- negative.
Klute offered us his services; we've accepted. positive.
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well -- positive.
Yes? negative.
He's in his room, playing. negative.
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one. positive.
Not particularly. negative.
Lunch in a restaurant. negative.
Wow!  French toast, really? negative.
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast. negative.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon. negative.
You got a letter from mom. negative.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers. negative.
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry. negative.
In a minute... negative.
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake... negative.
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and-- negative.
I hate it. positive.
No. negative.
No! negative.
You're no bargain either, pal. negative.
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me. negative.
Yeah? positive.
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late. positive.
Uh huh? negative.
You mean for good? positive.
See you in the morning light... negative.
Sure.  Lots of times. negative.
It's my name too. negative.
Yep. negative.
Uh, huh? negative.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King. positive.
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep? positive.
Sustained. negative.
Yes, your honor. negative.
Six years. negative.
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life? positive.
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job. negative.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand. negative.
Yes. negative.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently? negative.
I suppose... negative.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think-- positive.
What? negative.
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother-- negative.
Fine. negative.
You've been living here, in the city? negative.
Yeah, well he did, didn't he. negative.
Joanna, what the hell is-- negative.
What? negative.
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late-- negative.
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine. positive.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that. positive.
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back. negative.
That's my decision, Ted and that's final. negative.
I know....I know. positive.
Fine. negative.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line. negative.
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship. positive.
Ten. negative.
No. negative.
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him. negative.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and-- positive.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did. positive.
I'm gonna keep him, why? negative.
Got it. negative.
Ted, I just heard... positive.
Ha!  You tell me. positive.
A moment. negative.
Yes, Holiness. negative.
But, I am in charge. positive.
No! negative.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend. negative.
Soon. negative.
The Sera monks have surrendered? negative.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it. positive.
All? negative.
I am afraid. negative.
Far, far away. positive.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die. negative.
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here. negative.
Answer. negative.
You could buy them. negative.
Can India help us? negative.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes. negative.
The people will not allow it. negative.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders. positive.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial. positive.
I leave tomorrow. negative.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this. negative.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe. negative.
I will miss you. negative.
And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder. negative.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me? negative.
It is a difficult situation. negative.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept. negative.
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad. negative.
Oh yes.  I killed him. negative.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead. negative.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!! negative.
Mr. Cyr! negative.
I coulda shot you, you-- negative.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet. negative.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me. negative.
Then do it!! positive.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive. negative.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe. positive.
I don't know! positive.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to-- positive.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,-- negative.
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant. negative.
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie. positive.
Thank you, Jack. negative.
Tranq guns down, rifles up! negative.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger-- positive.
You talk to Bickerman? negative.
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority-- negative.
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts? negative.
Oh, bullshit. negative.
No. negative.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess. negative.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well. negative.
Never been to Maine before? negative.
So I don't like tents, why-- negative.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't-- negative.
Who? negative.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there... negative.
I'd be able to see something. negative.
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one. negative.
I beg your pardon? negative.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows-- negative.
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of-- negative.
Good.  See ya soon. negative.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints. negative.
Excuse me? negative.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised. negative.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter. positive.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here. negative.
You're mushing it a little around the-- positive.
Well... negative.
You wouldn't? negative.
Obviously I was wrong! negative.
We shouldn't even really be doing this. negative.
I'll take it! negative.
We're staying in <u>tents</u>? negative.
<u>Apologize</u>? negative.
<u>That</u> was a bust. negative.
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down? negative.
What? negative.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you? negative.
A jerk. negative.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out. negative.
Kelly-- negative.
Kevin told me you were upset. negative.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and... negative.
Shitbutt? negative.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...? positive.
Agent Mapp! Thank you! negative.
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries. negative.
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy. negative.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion. negative.
Okay, Mr. Yow... negative.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago. negative.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now. negative.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim. negative.
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice. positive.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me. negative.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work. negative.
Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter? positive.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters. negative.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon. positive.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself? negative.
I think so. positive.
May I see your credentials? negative.
Yes. negative.
How many women has he used, our Bill? negative.
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day. negative.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab? negative.
Because you weren't wasting my time. negative.
I don't know. Is it? positive.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there. positive.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know. positive.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life. positive.
Why so briefly? negative.
Did he try to? negative.
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect. negative.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying. negative.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is. positive.
Early. Still dark. negative.
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy... negative.
Yes... negative.
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know. positive.
Yes. I'll tell you. positive.
You want to see a violation? This is a violation... negative.
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture. positive.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose? negative.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know. negative.
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall. negative.
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you." negative.
I'm sorry. negative.
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it. positive.
Maybe... positive.
...never doubt what you are doing. negative.
Alice? negative.
There was none! positive.
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too! positive.
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"... negative.
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...? negative.
Yes. Yes, I will. negative.
I am sorry, Duncan... negative.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said... positive.
Came across the war party, tracked 'em. negative.
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee. negative.
That is sedition! Treason! negative.
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground! positive.
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands... positive.
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes? negative.
We'll see in the morning... negative.
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites. negative.

Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's. negative.
Get your fingers out of my soup! negative.

You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it? positive.
What? negative.
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it. negative.

I was too busy. negative.

Not if I can help it. negative.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for. positive.

Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me-- negative.

Nothing. negative.
I came back 'cause you were here. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on. positive.

Do you? negative.
Sure. negative.
Why?  Because he had you? negative.
You didn't marry him for love. negative.
That's my business. Harry. negative.
Why don't you tell me the truth? negative.

He deserved it. negative.

On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request? negative.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes. negative.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death. positive.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense. negative.
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it. negative.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life. negative.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya. negative.

I think you gave me the wrong one. positive.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one. negative.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me? negative.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me. negative.
Until it happens, you're still a human being. negative.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set? negative.
Terrific. negative.
And what's that mean? negative.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight? negative.

Get out of here. negative.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not. positive.
Thanks for having me, Sally. negative.

He's looking right at me. negative.

Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion. negative.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing. positive.

What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad. negative.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife. negative.
She's alright. negative.

What? negative.

What? negative.
So you're gonna bitch up? negative.
Business folks. negative.
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold. negative.
Sorry.  You okay? negative.
You know, people. positive.
I'm also good enough to go pro. negative.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true. negative.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days... negative.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father. positive.

What name?  My name? negative.
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he. negative.
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very... negative.
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion -- negative.
Yeah. positive.
...ok... negative.
Quietly, slow down, whoa -- negative.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance -- positive.
No one else in here? positive.
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now? negative.
Ok. What's your name? negative.
No. negative.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay -- negative.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy? negative.
Yes. negative.
I need you to get me Paula -- negative.

I'm a bad person. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Yes. negative.
I really don't know. positive.
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>. positive.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay? negative.
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean -- negative.
No.  But I probably will get a call back. negative.
Like what? negative.
No they don't -- negative.
Hang up the phone. negative.
818-753-0088. negative.
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter. negative.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal? negative.
Thank you. negative.
I gotta go to the bathroom. positive.
I'm fine. nothing. negative.
It's not right. negative.
No, stay back!  Stay back! negative.
May I speak with you?  Alone? positive.
I wish to discuss your brother. negative.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner. negative.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me! positive.
He is your brother! negative.
No, Louis!  No! negative.
Come, we have a boat waiting. negative.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant! positive.
You grow fond of him.  That's good. negative.
But -- what is he doing? negative.
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice? negative.
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days. negative.
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards! negative.
I know.  God go with you. positive.
You can't do it. negative.
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip. negative.
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river? negative.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos? positive.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret! negative.
Bread and wine... in that cupboard. negative.
He is right, d'Artagnan. negative.
Who does? negative.
You are right.  But it is a trap. negative.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you. negative.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months? positive.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh? negative.
I know. positive.
Save my son, d'Artagnan. negative.
The King killed my son! negative.
It is something I have done -- or did not do. positive.
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with. positive.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone! negative.
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you. negative.
And you never knew why? negative.
I decided it this morning. positive.
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish! negative.
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor! negative.
... You knew you had a double? negative.
I must insist, Sire. negative.
I am unhurt -- negative.
Thank you, Keeper. negative.
... Two-thirty-seven. negative.
What was the end page? negative.
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front. negative.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it. negative.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty! negative.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that? negative.
Raoul... is in love... negative.
It's lovely.  It's just... positive.
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger. positive.
Oh Louis, Louis... negative.
Yeah? positive.
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission! negative.
Cooperate? negative.
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something. negative.
These crowds are going to make it a bitch! negative.
Fine - positive.
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone? negative.
Did you start out area six? negative.
What? negative.
It's just...catching up with me, you know? positive.
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us. negative.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!! negative.
You're the mysterious type, right? negative.
No... negative.
You'll find out - soon enough. positive.
No.  A witness. negative.
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened. positive.
Yeah...they did.  One girl... negative.
Yeah. positive.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk? negative.
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law? positive.
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help! negative.
How about Marvosa and the others? negative.
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess. negative.
Both at the same bank... negative.
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket. negative.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean? positive.
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature. negative.
What's the bottom line? negative.
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it? negative.
Twenty minutes max. negative.
Will Graham, Jack Crawford... negative.
Because it's his bad luck to be special. negative.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'... positive.
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions? negative.
You said the guy down here is good. positive.
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it. negative.
See? You do know something about him. positive.
To recover the mind set. negative.
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler. positive.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you. negative.
Wait, Will... negative.
When I'm done. negative.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows. negative.

They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract. positive.
Uh-huh. negative.
It's a surprise. negative.
I'm fine, Francis. negative.
Francis? Where are you? negative.
It's me. negative.
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand. negative.
No. negative.
I'm very scared. negative.
Yes. negative.
Yes... negative.
No. negative.
You'll let me go now? negative.
Yeah. It's right here. positive.
Uh... sure... negative.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and.... negative.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious? negative.
Hi, Linda. .. negative.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham. negative.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too positive.
Thank you very much. positive.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not. positive.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not. negative.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him. positive.
None you'd notice. I'm lonely... negative.
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it... positive.
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon. negative.
Yes. I said this is too good to live... negative.
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me? negative.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and... negative.
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days... negative.
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he? negative.
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home... negative.
Go on to the house... negative.
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and... negative.
Yeah... positive.
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty. positive.
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed. negative.
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are. positive.
...yes. negative.
I keep getting it for Christmas. negative.
Very interesting, even to a layman. negative.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are. negative.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor. negative.
Fight what? negative.
Yes. negative.
I refuse. negative.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that. positive.
Hi George! negative.
But wasn't it funny? positive.
What, you don't think I can beat him? positive.
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease. negative.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy. positive.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money. positive.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go... negative.
Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together. positive.
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day. positive.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond." positive.
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married? negative.
I can shtop whenever I want... negative.
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...! negative.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks. negative.
Don't worry!  The kids will love it -- positive.
Then your father's a wimp. negative.
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years. negative.
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns. negative.
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything. negative.
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here. negative.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge! positive.
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places. positive.
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you! positive.
I used to think you were original. positive.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry. positive.
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga. positive.
They're gonna lynch him! positive.
What's your name? negative.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable. negative.
Hurry! negative.
And you are? negative.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass. positive.
Oh, God. negative.
It's Choi. negative.
If you get caught using that -- negative.
Yeah, 'course I'm sure. negative.
An accident?! negative.
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you. negative.
Sorry. negative.
How? negative.
Any time. negative.
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store. negative.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure? negative.
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it. negative.
What do you know? positive.
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life. negative.
This can't be... negative.
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them. negative.
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence? negative.
Because... I didn't think I would? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Why? negative.
Yes I do. positive.
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me. positive.
Morpheus, I don't know -- positive.
Yes, sir. negative.
Do it! negative.
Honestly?  I don't know. positive.
What? negative.
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced. negative.
From you. positive.
Why? negative.
Are you worried? negative.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu. positive.
I don't know.  It just went dead. positive.
I believe I can bring him back. negative.
I'm coming with you. negative.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else. negative.
Not yet. negative.
No. negative.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion. positive.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it. positive.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time. negative.
What do they want? negative.
Neo, this has to be done! negative.
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go. negative.
Tank, it's me. negative.
Let go of her. negative.
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you... negative.
Why? negative.
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you. negative.
Be careful. negative.
She don't look Jewish. positive.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination. negative.
Giovanino!  Where have you been? negative.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this. negative.
Didn't show up. negative.
Listen...I'm a guest here. negative.
Cut it out stupid.  It's me. negative.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this. positive.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash? negative.
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. negative.
Don't be smart. positive.
I'll be here.  Don't worry. positive.
Good idea. negative.
We'll be here. positive.
Fine. negative.
I know. positive.
Hostess? negative.
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head. negative.
What do they expect you to say? negative.
Oh yeah, that's a possibility. negative.
Wha? negative.
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good. positive.
Well... negative.
Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food. negative.
You're intolerable today. negative.
Well you can't blame them in a way. negative.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine. negative.
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!! negative.
But... positive.
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me? negative.
We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves. negative.
I know...I know. positive.
Hi, Allison -- negative.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect -- positive.
We've got some things to discuss. positive.
It's for the party, Dad -- negative.
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York! positive.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert. negative.
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer. negative.
Both. negative.
I thought you were buying my company. positive.
You mean this, sir? positive.
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste? negative.
Right away. positive.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations. negative.
"Death and Taxes"? negative.
Yes. negative.
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations? negative.
A voice? negative.
Me, too. negative.
Uh -- he's from out of town -- negative.
How nice for you both. negative.
As much as Joe's? positive.
For how long?  And why? negative.
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer. negative.
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you? negative.
I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains. positive.
Thanks, Quince. negative.
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park. negative.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs. positive.
No, no.  I on holiday. negative.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way. negative.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you? negative.
You loved back? negative.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty. negative.
Hi, Jennifer. negative.
Sure. negative.
You're welcome. negative.
I'm lost. negative.
Peanut butter. negative.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends. negative.
Watch me do what? positive.
Yes. negative.
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back. negative.
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married. negative.
Girlfriend? negative.
I said get out. negative.
And is your heart beating strangely? negative.
I love you in an evening gown. negative.
Where are you going? negative.
It gets worse. negative.
We know all that we need to know -- positive.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back -- negative.
-- Yes? negative.
Thank you. negative.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad? negative.
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time. negative.
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly. positive.
It is a deal? negative.
I guess so. negative.
Make an exception? negative.
That's what everybody says. negative.
Can you keep a secret? negative.
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill? negative.
Of course. negative.
Oh.  Okay. negative.
This part I'm interested in. negative.
I wouldn't put it that way. positive.
'Fish'? positive.
This universe? positive.
Yes? negative.
What are you saying, that it's time to go? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters. negative.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love. negative.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about. positive.
Get him in here. negative.
And we're very grateful. negative.
Thank you. negative.
That's life.  What can I tell you? positive.
Death! negative.
Speak up, please. negative.
Then don't. positive.
What? negative.
What the hell is this?  Who are you? negative.
I want to have a look around before I take you. positive.
How's that, Quince? negative.
Yeah, I give a shit. positive.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you? negative.
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong. positive.
Sir, I'll deliver the package. negative.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay? negative.
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope. negative.
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you. positive.
You like him, don't you? positive.
You're not listening -- negative.
We've met. negative.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor. negative.
Will it?... negative.
Yeah, it's good to get together. negative.
It's something. positive.
Joe? negative.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me? negative.
Where's he going? negative.
I'm having a helluva time. negative.
Yes, but -- positive.
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me. negative.
The fireworks are about to start. negative.
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why? positive.
You never know.  Lightning could strike. positive.
But we've got time. positive.
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful. negative.
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable. negative.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you? positive.
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom. positive.
Just loud enough to wake me up. positive.
I'm sorry... um... ? negative.
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 negative.
What's it like? negative.
Seen you together, that's all. negative.
Then why is this my handwriting? negative.
Leonard. negative.
Hi, Leonard. negative.
That's right I did, didn't I? negative.
I forget. negative.
I don't want blood on them. positive.
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition - negative.
Yes. negative.
Sorry. negative.
Don't remember. negative.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help. negative.
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes. positive.
Who did he go to meet? negative.
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people. positive.
And what did he say? negative.
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else. positive.
Calls himself Dodd. negative.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right? negative.
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?! positive.
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 * negative.
Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  * positive.
How do you know about me? negative.
Are you Teddy? negative.
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal. negative.
It's good. negative.
I enjoy it. negative.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name. positive.
Mr Gammell? negative.
You said you were leaving town. negative.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live. positive.
No! Should I? negative.
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about. negative.
Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. positive.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you? positive.

Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you? positive.
And what do I do with him? positive.

Affirmative. negative.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market. negative.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it? negative.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans? negative.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri. negative.

I'm getting dressed. negative.
I've got my duties to attend to. positive.

Back and upper corridors. negative.
That's not good enough. negative.
Yes.  I do. positive.

I am a blank sheet. negative.
This is the top. positive.
She trusts you, John. negative.
For once in my life, I am not the issue. positive.
In time, she will. positive.
I'm glad of it. negative.

And I intend to be there when she's ready. negative.
It's a fine spot, ma'am. negative.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank-- negative.
What? negative.
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson. positive.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please. negative.
Have I ever let you down before--? negative.
I'm breaking no promises! negative.
The question is, do we need her? negative.
Who? negative.

He? negative.
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored... negative.
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that. positive.

Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right? negative.
We are talking... negative.
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow. negative.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it... positive.
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know. positive.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens. positive.

Are you okay? negative.
What? negative.
But you won't. negative.
Diane? negative.

I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me. positive.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ? negative.
I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years. negative.
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ? negative.
Fine... negative.
You don't. It's random, there no trick. positive.
It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it. positive.

Look... negative.
That's cute asshole. negative.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here. negative.
Not yet. negative.
When will that be ? negative.
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ? negative.
He probably has a history of this shit. positive.
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets... negative.
Son, let's watch the tape. positive.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess. positive.

Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind? positive.
Great. positive.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece! negative.
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float. positive.
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already? negative.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy. negative.
You can do anything you want. You're his sister. negative.
You're being narrow-minded. negative.
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think... positive.

Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip. negative.
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances. positive.
Bye. negative.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around. positive.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled? negative.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing... negative.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me? negative.

All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites. negative.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike. positive.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning. positive.
What do you mean? negative.
But what about you and the baby? You need me. negative.
You have no idea. positive.
He is? negative.

No, but it traced me. positive.
Prepping your trip. negative.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems. negative.

Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out. negative.
What's my end? negative.

She did, huh. negative.
You believe that? negative.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will? positive.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down. negative.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights. negative.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks. positive.
I see better with them on. negative.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up. negative.
In the trunk? negative.
Yeah?  She said that to you? negative.
You know who they are? negative.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way. negative.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute. negative.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house. negative.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there. negative.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place. negative.
Yeah.  That was the ninth. positive.
Hejira. negative.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van. negative.
Glenn? negative.
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there. negative.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do. negative.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me. positive.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here? negative.
Can I do what? negative.
I <i>was</i>... negative.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl. positive.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled. negative.
Thanks. negative.
What did you call it? negative.
Something better.  Open it. positive.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke? negative.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy? negative.
He's still married though, huh? negative.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em. negative.
We don't get to talk much any more. positive.
I'd like that. negative.
Huh. negative.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday. positive.
I see that. negative.
He's pretty laid back, confident. negative.
So? negative.
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks. negative.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four. negative.
Yeah, as soon as we got back. negative.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase. negative.
Well, I need that... positive.
Jack Foley, famous bank robber. negative.
That's your line for tonight, ya know. negative.
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming? negative.
Red...Strange? negative.
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange? negative.
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter. negative.
Sir? negative.
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds. negative.
The one that slept in my mouth last night. negative.
Good shooting, Rafe! negative.
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air! negative.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her. positive.
Upset?  Why should I be upset? negative.
What facts are those? negative.
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn. negative.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help. positive.
Home of the brave. positive.
I'm out of fuel! negative.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help. positive.
I can't make it. negative.
You were more like brothers. positive.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him. negative.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe? positive.
Hang on. negative.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne. positive.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play -- negative.
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die. positive.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not. negative.
Respect. negative.
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect? negative.
Nice to meet you, Betty. negative.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you. positive.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back. negative.
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just -- positive.
Brilliant, Admiral. negative.
God help them. positive.
All of 'em. negative.
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor. negative.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do? negative.
Goodbye, Grandma. negative.
Stag movies. Smokers. negative.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before? positive.
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats. negative.
You're probably the only one who could carry it off. negative.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie. positive.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust. positive.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way. negative.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are. negative.
That's disgusting! negative.
Don't say that... positive.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed. negative.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off. negative.
I'm not going. negative.
Pretty strange. positive.
They'll learn to live with it. positive.
Would you? negative.
Thanks. negative.
I thought it had a lot of merit. negative.
Rejected, worthless, miserable. negative.
Good. negative.
Great, isn't it? positive.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in. negative.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts. negative.
What am I going to do with you? positive.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm. positive.
I just can't trust you anymore. positive.
It means I care about you and what happens to you. negative.
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres. positive.
You're going to listen to me. negative.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years. negative.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you. negative.
Oh, God, Dion. negative.
Test? negative.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion. negative.
Okay. negative.
I wish she hadn't. positive.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you. negative.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late. positive.
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth? negative.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet. negative.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature. positive.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life! positive.
Don't you get along with your parents? negative.
They care about you. They're just a different generation. negative.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer. negative.
Evelyn, put her to bed. negative.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up. negative.
Wrong, Dad. Your idea. negative.
Please don't shout. negative.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home. negative.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today? negative.
I had a dream that Grandma died. negative.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them. negative.
What do you mean? negative.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills. negative.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself. negative.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself. positive.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this. positive.
You're a sweet man, Richard. negative.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died. negative.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious. negative.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life! positive.
High tech. I like the sound of that. positive.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny. negative.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht. negative.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen. negative.
I couldn't help it  I loved him. positive.
So are you. You've got a vision. positive.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this? positive.
How'd you know that? positive.
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea. negative.
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in. positive.
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young. positive.
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs. positive.
You alright? negative.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back... negative.
Anywhere but here. negative.
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive. negative.
He was dead. You know he was. positive.
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances... negative.
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you... positive.
Right here, Mom... negative.
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool. positive.
I don't know what to do, Bob. positive.
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint? positive.
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired? positive.
I said, don't worry about it. negative.
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment. positive.
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK! negative.
Of course. negative.
More than your friend. Family. negative.
I'm seeing him this afternoon. negative.
I have AIDS. negative.
One week old. negative.
Continue. negative.
We? negative.
Your... lover? negative.
Makeup. negative.
Fine. negative.
Let's find you a drink. positive.
Thank you. negative.
Correct. negative.
Do you... pray? negative.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area... positive.
Thanks.  Do you like opera? positive.
Want to hear my favorite aria? negative.
I suppose you could say that. positive.
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club... positive.
I'm an excellent lawyer. negative.
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens. positive.
Not unnecessary ones. negative.
I guess it was 1984, 85. negative.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right? negative.
Thank you. negative.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights. negative.
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater? negative.
Get real. negative.
Uh.... No. Not really. negative.
That's correct. negative.
We won. negative.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now. positive.
What kind of people? negative.
How many do you know? positive.
Who? negative.
Yeah... ? positive.
Great, Lisa. Thank you. positive.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk? negative.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares? positive.
How did you do that? negative.
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob? negative.
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material? negative.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?" negative.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves... negative.
Lookit. Lookit! negative.
<u>What</u>? negative.
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now? negative.
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner. negative.
Show me your eyes. negative.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time. negative.
Entered our minds. negative.
Saw something I didn't like. positive.
<u>Listen</u>. negative.
Think about what? positive.
You sure you can keep -- negative.
We can't make it. negative.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck. positive.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are. positive.
Don't do this to me.... negative.
Big Evil? negative.
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on -- positive.
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep. positive.
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset. positive.
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch? negative.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts. negative.
How many? negative.
Let's wait on the power cells. negative.
That's what I said. negative.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' -- negative.
I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat. negative.
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team. negative.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when -- positive.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking -- negative.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to -- positive.
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when -- negative.
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there.... positive.
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility? negative.
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out! negative.
You know who Muhammad was? negative.
Rain. negative.
Which half? negative.
I'm born-again. negative.
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then. positive.
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these. negative.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare. negative.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up. negative.
Say that again. positive.
Looks clear. negative.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you? negative.
No. She's not. positive.
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood. negative.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct. positive.
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse. negative.
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right? positive.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius? negative.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations. negative.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy. negative.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you? positive.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing. negative.
What are you doing there? negative.
No. negative.
Remembers what? negative.
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One. negative.
And they fell out of the sky with you? negative.
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you? negative.
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it. positive.
I don't. And I'm not going to try. negative.
No, they won't - negative.
It's probably wrong -- negative.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us. negative.
Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon. negative.
Let's find them all. negative.
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here? negative.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority. negative.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet. negative.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk. negative.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do. positive.
We're here to stay. negative.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months. negative.
Climb off me, will you! negative.
Let's take a look. negative.
Try telling them our names. negative.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet. positive.
What is it? negative.
I think you're making a mistake. positive.
A man, Dr. Maximus. negative.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation. positive.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man? negative.
What about it? negative.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started? positive.
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned. negative.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you! negative.
Shhhh! negative.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone? negative.
Taylor, please -- negative.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly! negative.
Like you, I find it difficult. positive.
Where? negative.
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight. negative.

I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position. negative.
Shaddup bitch. negative.
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke. negative.
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on. negative.
Then what do you suggest big shot? negative.
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes! negative.
Hey take it easy man. They're scared. negative.
Out there man - behind the log. negative.
No! negative.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die? positive.
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now... negative.
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit. positive.
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor?

Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking... negative.
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US. negative.
He dugged his own grave. negative.
These two holes are yours... negative.
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else. negative.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation? negative.
I really don't know. positive.
Very nice Mitchell turns. positive.
I'm supposing. negative.
I haven't been invited. negative.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it. negative.
How do you do? negative.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle? negative.
Bank? negative.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties. positive.
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff? negative.
Much too late. positive.
That's all there is. negative.
I'd rather wait until it does matter. negative.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance. positive.
They know you here--know your name. positive.
Couldn't be. negative.
Absolutely sure. negative.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman. positive.
So have I. negative.
They'll look for you. positive.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth. negative.
You-killed-him? negative.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore. negative.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him. negative.
Do you think I was faking? positive.
Beer?  Well, all right. negative.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to. positive.
Who told you I was married? negative.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders. negative.
Who hasn't--one way or another? negative.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department? positive.
You understand perfectly. negative.
I don't want to talk. negative.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it. negative.
What does he see? negative.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears. positive.
Because you think your in love with me? negative.
I know that. positive.
I'm not interested in blind dates. negative.
You asked for it. negative.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding. negative.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer. positive.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon. negative.
For five hundred, what do I get? negative.
Why not here? negative.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him. negative.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour? negative.
I never notice the view after the first week. negative.
Would that make me a heel? negative.
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was? positive.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here. negative.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she? negative.
What? negative.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another. positive.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him. negative.
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun. negative.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why. positive.
Would you? negative.
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there. positive.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark. negative.
I think so. positive.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise. negative.
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream. negative.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her. negative.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you. positive.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag. negative.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon. negative.
You didn't play it for laughs last night. negative.
Mortar shells are not funny, either. negative.
That leaves two strangers. negative.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours. negative.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive. negative.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir. negative.
Two. negative.
What are my orders, sir? negative.
What does it look like? negative.
You already have the checks, darling. negative.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me? negative.
How about your new friend? positive.
In an hour, Larry. negative.
It's kind of you to see me. negative.
It's fine, thank you. negative.
I think you'll do very well. positive.
Well, we were just... positive.
Sit on that log, dear. negative.

It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice. positive.
A glamorous young lady way above his station... negative.
And I didn't like that man. negative.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job. negative.
Who? negative.
I have to be up early. negative.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you. negative.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink. negative.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese. negative.
Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas. negative.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA. negative.
Let me see. positive.
Mmm... negative.
Ha ha... positive.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake. negative.

The bed's all made up if you want to stay. negative.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch. negative.
You'd look naked without one. negative.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress. negative.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead. negative.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it. positive.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world. negative.

1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before. negative.
A little mushy. positive.

Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish. negative.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys? negative.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products. negative.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet. positive.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it? negative.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on. negative.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are. negative.
I need you to teach me. negative.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride. negative.
People are expendable to Bodhi. positive.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different. negative.

Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here. positive.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that? negative.

Anytime. negative.

I saw it. positive.
Thank you, Sergeant. negative.
There's something else, Major... positive.
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi... positive.
There's no sign of it. negative.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town? negative.
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes? negative.
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot. negative.
No. negative.
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything. negative.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks. negative.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that. negative.
What's that? negative.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills? negative.
What motel you staying at? negative.

No. negative.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard. negative.

Vivian, what the -- negative.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off. negative.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however... negative.
You won't. negative.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone? negative.

I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please. negative.

Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks... negative.
Yeah.  I just got it. positive.
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway. negative.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know. positive.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow. negative.
And who is that? negative.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely. negative.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow. negative.
Yes.  Something... conservative. negative.
I don't think it would fit you. positive.
I was in here yesterday. negative.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again. negative.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes? negative.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you... negative.
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago? positive.
And what am I? negative.
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly. negative.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57. negative.

Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s? negative.
What hideous sin have you committed lately? negative.
Did you say, "I do"? positive.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness? negative.
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38. positive.
Who's Guilder? negative.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl. positive.

Everybody ... MOVE!! negative.
I have a little. positive.
Over the Albino, I think. positive.
Right, right, sorry. negative.
What? negative.

What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book? negative.
Someday, you may not mind so much. positive.

I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75. negative.
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH! negative.
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years? negative.
He's already dead. negative.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated positive.
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97. positive.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done. negative.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so. positive.
No one of consequence. negative.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either -- negative.

Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates? negative.
Good. Then pour the wine. negative.
I'm not listening. negative.
It would take a miracle. Bye! negative.
What? negative.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business? negative.
Do the books!  Do the books! positive.
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there. negative.
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute? negative.
Well, sir, it seems ... negative.
Where?  What? negative.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make? negative.
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ... negative.
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius. negative.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory? negative.
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me. positive.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch. negative.
Right. negative.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies! negative.
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag. negative.
No way out.  No way out. negative.
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play. negative.
No kidding? negative.
Really, I never dreamed ... negative.
We swear it! negative.
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you. negative.
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept. negative.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong? negative.
Call chauffeur.  Get car. negative.
Very nice girl. positive.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work. negative.

She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered... positive.
What? negative.
Of which morning? negative.
Or arrived with her. positive.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally? positive.
Back where? negative.
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother? negative.
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think... positive.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add. negative.
What? negative.
Can I trade in my car and take another? positive.
Five hundred. negative.

Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and... negative.
Buzz me the minute she comes in. negative.
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale? negative.
With the forty thousand dollars? positive.
Just what he told your detective. negative.
May I talk to you? negative.
I want to know if my sister is here. positive.
What do you know about it? positive.
I hate tears. positive.
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that! negative.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam. negative.
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better. negative.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there! negative.
Sam! Why call when we can go? negative.
Sam. negative.
Without calling me? negative.
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything... negative.
Who's he? negative.
This is the old highway. negative.
Watch your tenses. positive.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers! positive.
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move. positive.
Hospital clean. negative.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean! negative.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this. negative.
I've lost my girlish laughter. positive.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here... negative.
No. negative.
Sam! No! negative.
I'm thinking of it. negative.
Los Angeles. negative.
The bathroom. negative.
No. negative.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh? positive.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you? positive.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch. negative.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill. positive.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. negative.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring... negative.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too. negative.
I'd like to, but... negative.
Good night. negative.

I'm sorry. negative.
Why? negative.
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking. negative.
Maybe you saw Mary! positive.
He's already been. negative.
Arbogast. negative.
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right? negative.
I suppose you want a cabin. negative.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk. negative.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy. negative.
Leave me alone! negative.
Left Phoenix under her own steam? negative.
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit... positive.
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path. negative.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives. negative.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly. negative.
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money. negative.
That sounds to me very remarkable. positive.
Why didn't you notify the police? negative.
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats. negative.

Well, news of Buckley? negative.

A voice ... negative.
Yes! negative.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks. positive.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria. negative.
I don't agree with you. positive.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune. negative.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty. positive.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight. negative.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence. negative.
I'm not quarreling, only ... negative.
I'd call it stupid at any time. negative.
So that's the way it is? positive.
At any time. You will always be welcome. positive.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs? negative.
You mean he was colored? positive.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again? positive.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation? positive.
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it. positive.
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens? negative.
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! positive.
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break. positive.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. negative.
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep. negative.
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid. negative.
Now don't that call for an extra! negative.
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right. positive.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America. negative.
Almost certain. negative.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous! negative.
Where were you going when you got in that cab? negative.
How's every little thing? positive.
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired! negative.
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me. negative.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you. negative.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before -- positive.
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends. negative.
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda. negative.
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy. negative.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ... negative.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health? negative.
You're insane. negative.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it? negative.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present. positive.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come. negative.
Dad... negative.
Excuse me??? negative.
Day or night? negative.
What universe are you in, Paul? negative.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia. positive.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together -- negative.
Wait.  I want to tell you something. negative.
Then you get it.  You'll understand. negative.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil. positive.
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that. positive.
They were just bad men, that's all. negative.
What did you expect? negative.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe. positive.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next. negative.
But why, if I'm not hurting you? negative.
I said I wouldn't. negative.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people. positive.
What are you going to do, Rose? negative.
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you! positive.
No. Why should Rose be in my room? negative.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her? positive.
What did you say, Brother? negative.
No, you didn't say that, Brother. positive.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this. positive.
Okay. negative.
At least. positive.
They're discussing it. negative.
Let me see! positive.
Boy! Wow! negative.
What are they doing? negative.
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll. positive.
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on. negative.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close. positive.
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house. negative.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow? positive.
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her? positive.
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say? negative.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son. positive.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that. negative.
No, son, she is dead. positive.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened. negative.
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you. negative.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children. positive.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer? positive.
I think we both know her. positive.
What? negative.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home. negative.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him. negative.
You're not having lunch? negative.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why. negative.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody. negative.
What time is it? negative.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe. positive.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body! negative.
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her. positive.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly... negative.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it... negative.
Honey, please... negative.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go. negative.
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear? negative.
What did you forget? negative.
Over... my... dead... body! negative.
Fine. negative.
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows. negative.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him. negative.
I... I'll get the grits. negative.
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much... positive.
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom. positive.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours. negative.
Well, it has buttons. negative.
There are more on the other side. negative.
Oh, anywhere downtown. negative.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there. positive.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night. negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Well, it's Billy. negative.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman. negative.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you? negative.
Tennessee? negative.
Well. What kinda job is it? negative.
What? negative.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer? negative.
Page proof of a book I'm working on. negative.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet. negative.
She has other things to do, Dave. positive.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life. positive.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'! positive.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals. positive.
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor. negative.
Oh, Mother, cut it out. negative.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her. negative.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too. negative.
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer? negative.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say. positive.
I was offered that job as a waitress. negative.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose. negative.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up? negative.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got. positive.
Now you know what to watch for... positive.
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine... negative.
Fair enough. negative.
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back? positive.
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you. negative.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again. negative.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared. negative.
I'm just saying... negative.
What? negative.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh? negative.
You don't smoke. negative.
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July. positive.
What was I supposed to do? negative.
... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?... positive.
We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window? negative.
What? negative.
Murderer?  Really? negative.
Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams. negative.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner." negative.
Absolutely. negative.
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming. positive.
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked. negative.
I know it is, even if you don't. positive.
A.D. is a C.P.A. negative.
Your wish is my command. negative.
Who is that... ? negative.
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer? negative.
Beholden to none. negative.
Know what I love about dynamite? negative.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. negative.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. positive.
Who are you? negative.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for. negative.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. positive.
His lightsaber. negative.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. negative.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber? positive.
Han, don't. It'll be all right. positive.
That's all any of us can see. negative.
Charges!  Come on, come on! negative.
No, wait! I thought you were blind! negative.
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later. negative.
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. negative.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh? negative.
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. positive.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. negative.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. negative.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. negative.
Your Royal Highness. negative.
Oh, no. negative.
I see them. Wait, Leia! negative.
Just...images, really. Feelings. negative.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you? negative.
I know. Somehow...I've always known. positive.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. positive.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. negative.
Oh. Well, yes. negative.
Disintegrated? negative.
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual. positive.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room. negative.
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools. positive.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook. positive.
It's just a..a party Janet. positive.
It's alright Janet. negative.
No, don't do that. positive.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known. negative.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K. negative.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew. negative.
I didn't make him for you negative.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself. positive.
Makes you cry negative.
Oh my, my, negative.
Free to try and find a game positive.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime. positive.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right... positive.
And our World will do the Time Warp again. negative.
...I'm sorry. negative.
...I don't know. positive.
...I suppose. negative.
...No thanks. negative.
It's not that -- negative.
I don't think I belong here. positive.
I should leave. negative.
Do me another favor? positive.
Don't tease me. negative.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that? positive.
Yes. negative.
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag? negative.
No... Sharp -- You look great. negative.
I gotta go out for a while. negative.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard. negative.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'. positive.

I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week. negative.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth? negative.
Very high an' very fast. negative.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls? negative.
Why? negative.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing -- positive.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right? negative.
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.' negative.
Charge it. negative.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts. negative.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell. negative.
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest. positive.
Bob. negative.
That's it, I'm broke. negative.
You have my food in ya hand. negative.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it... negative.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight? negative.
You think I don't hear things? positive.
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work -- negative.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses? positive.
No action. negative.
I'm gonna do somethin with it. positive.
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky. positive.
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner. negative.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate. negative.
I like yella teeth. positive.
Why? negative.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Come July, twenty-five. negative.
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker. negative.
How do you mean? negative.
Turtles -- domestic turtles. negative.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that. positive.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im. negative.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker. negative.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost? positive.
Real good. negative.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes! negative.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror. positive.
My sister's a friggin' loser. positive.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither. negative.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business. negative.
Try again, c'mon, try again. positive.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right? negative.
...Tight. negative.
Whatta these guys want? positive.
...People talk to me more. negative.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion? positive.
Shoulda guessed. negative.
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money. positive.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket. negative.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room? negative.
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open. negative.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife. negative.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory? negative.
Ask her... negative.
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that. negative.
What the hell's a freeway? negative.
What am I, Earl? negative.
Not much.  It's hard to talk. negative.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it? negative.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon. negative.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here. negative.
Only there's no business like it, no business I know. positive.
So what do you want me to do? negative.
So's the job. negative.
As soon as is humanly possible. negative.
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years. negative.
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing. positive.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer. negative.
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife. positive.
No, I don't. positive.
Divorce?  Never! negative.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie. negative.
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run. negative.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead. negative.
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body. negative.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'. positive.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding. positive.
Me. negative.
What is this, Twenty Questions? negative.
A Toon?  Noooo. negative.
Get away from there. negative.
Yeah? positive.
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay? negative.
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you. negative.
Uh? Uh? negative.
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight. positive.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep. positive.
But new struck cuz. positive.
Of love? negative.
No, cuz, I rather weep. negative.
Teach me how I should forget to think. negative.
Young Romeo is it? negative.
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me? negative.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies. negative.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today. negative.
Welcome. negative.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you. negative.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business. negative.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again. negative.
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send. negative.
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day? positive.
Speakest thou from thy heart? positive.
Amen negative.
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved. positive.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged. positive.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself. negative.
Ahhh! negative.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then. negative.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day. negative.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu. negative.
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die. positive.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed. negative.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. positive.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead positive.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink. negative.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing. negative.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy. positive.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much. negative.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married. positive.
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman. negative.
Do you really think so? negative.
Of course. negative.
Is that right? negative.
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on. negative.
Who the fuck are you? negative.
And then... negative.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss. negative.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness. negative.
They're good! negative.
You were a soldier, were you? negative.
Is that right? negative.
Duty calls? negative.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob. positive.
Don't even think that I'm buying that. negative.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it. negative.
Really?  Do you have the money with you? positive.
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now! negative.
Enough! negative.
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to... negative.
But you hate each other! positive.
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him. positive.
A post office box. negative.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me! negative.
That's it. negative.
There is one other thing... positive.
Not exactly. negative.
But first you have something to take care of? positive.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you. negative.
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way... positive.
Did he bring that with him? negative.
I blast the lead car into oblivion... negative.
I know cops -- and you're no cop. positive.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal. negative.
I do. negative.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this. negative.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless. negative.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore. negative.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to. positive.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out. positive.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all. negative.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did. positive.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have. positive.
Because I owe you.  Look at that... positive.
You think? positive.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me? negative.
Closest and oldest. negative.
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it? negative.
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked. positive.
Gonna be tough. positive.
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes. positive.
Dwayne listen to me - positive.
I don't know what you're - positive.
Cash and what? negative.
We'll figure something out. negative.
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions. positive.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it? negative.
Torch it?! negative.
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one... positive.
I...I can't do that. negative.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him. negative.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy! negative.
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth... negative.
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original. negative.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse. negative.
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break! positive.
You killed him... negative.
Then we're screwed. negative.
He found us, he shot her...he killed her... negative.
It's NOT too late! negative.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about negative.
Uh huh. negative.
Why don't you get to the point. negative.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down. negative.
How much? positive.
What are you proposing? negative.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that! positive.
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!! negative.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report. negative.
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation. positive.
You deserve it is the occasion. negative.
He's not, he's... negative.
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here. negative.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I? negative.
How the hell did he find it? negative.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all. negative.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on. positive.
What did he buy? negative.
Could it have been this? positive.
A week ago, at most. negative.
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you? positive.
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave? positive.
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity. negative.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office? negative.
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all. negative.
Is this marked money, or what? negative.
Hi. negative.
Have I seen her? negative.
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened. negative.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne. positive.
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that? negative.
We're gonna talk. negative.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all. positive.
Hi. negative.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say. negative.
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place. positive.
So someone did get away. negative.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that? positive.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit! negative.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money. positive.
No, sir. negative.
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he? negative.

What's your favorite scary movie? negative.
Closer than you think. positive.
But... positive.
Shush. negative.
I get scared really easy, okay. negative.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive. negative.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job. positive.
Good bye Ben. negative.
Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly. negative.
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS? negative.
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note. negative.
There's more. negative.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count. negative.
Absolutely. negative.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that. negative.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone. negative.
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott. positive.
What did you know about your mother? positive.
Catch him, or kill him. negative.
That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities. positive.
What Rielly? negative.
The killer called her. negative.
And what made you think it was Sidney? positive.
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh. negative.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me! negative.
And? negative.
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to? negative.
Sid, this is detective Kincaid. positive.
Just Jennifer.  And you. positive.
Do you want us to come with you? positive.
Nevermind, what'd you two find? negative.
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio. positive.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman. negative.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie? negative.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting? negative.
Oh shit it's my cell! negative.
What the hell are you doing? negative.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch. negative.
Need to get in that building? negative.
Gale Weathers would find a way. negative.
Who? negative.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards. negative.
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel. negative.
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?" negative.
I know! He killed Kincaid! negative.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets. negative.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering? positive.
Roman that's not the line. negative.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes? negative.
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here? positive.
Who is this? negative.
How do I know their voices are -- negative.
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die! negative.
I'll call you, when you're on your way. negative.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro. negative.
Who the fuck is this? negative.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk. negative.
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid. negative.
Where the fuck did she go? negative.
I just wanted to see her, that's all. negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff. positive.
I'll only stay a sec. positive.
Oh it did? negative.
What's that? negative.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me. negative.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy? positive.
It's okay. We need to talk. positive.
You lost your mom... negative.
Or even a good porno. negative.
What? negative.
It's okay. Give me the gun. negative.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive? positive.
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something. negative.
Who is this? negative.
I don't know. positive.
Why don't you want to talk to me? negative.
You're making popcorn? negative.
I only eat popcorn at the movies. negative.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend? positive.
You never told me your name. negative.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out. negative.
Don't hang up on me. negative.
You getting scared? negative.
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend. negative.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it? negative.
Guess. negative.
No... negative.
Come on. It'll be fun. positive.
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters. negative.
Come on, yes you do. negative.
YES! negative.
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH. negative.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill. negative.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry. negative.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale. negative.
Mind if I join you? negative.
What kind of lead? negative.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright? negative.
I don't think you're so bad. negative.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go. negative.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise. negative.
She's with me. I just wanted to check on things. positive.
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry. positive.
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up. negative.
Afraid not. negative.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus... positive.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through. positive.
Yes, sir, sheriff. negative.
You think he could still be in town? negative.
I told you to send it back. negative.
Call the police. negative.
You want to go live? negative.
Yes, that's right. negative.
It'll be out later this year. negative.
Forget it. negative.
I owe you shit. negative.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop. negative.
Who are you? negative.
No you didn't. positive.
Before she dumped him for Steve. positive.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something? negative.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste. negative.
And what would be your motive? negative.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one. negative.
The official term is "psychotic". negative.
It's past seven. negative.
I'm not worried. negative.
He was there, Tatum. positive.
It's alright. I'll get it. negative.
It was him, Tatum. I know it. positive.
I don't know... positive.
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night. negative.
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve. positive.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you. negative.
Give it to me. negative.
Thank you. negative.
Ease back, Mills. negative.
Announcing what? negative.
So what?  This victim... negative.
Greed.  It was written in blood. negative.
Yeah. positive.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house. positive.
Who are you?  What are you doing out here? negative.
Murderers like you? positive.
Delusions of grandeur. negative.
I seem to remember knocking on your door. negative.
What the fuck is going on here?! negative.
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here? negative.
I realize that. negative.
Please be quiet for a while, would you? negative.
Is there any blood in it? positive.
No. negative.
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know... positive.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional. positive.
Whoa, whoa... what?! negative.
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept. negative.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order. negative.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you. negative.
Nothing. negative.
Okay.  But, what? negative.
It's got to be. negative.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us. negative.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop. positive.
And you don't? negative.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing. negative.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him. positive.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue. positive.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired. negative.
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him. negative.
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face. negative.
You got to be kidding. negative.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza. negative.
I don't.  Neither do you. positive.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen. negative.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him. positive.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work. positive.
We had him. negative.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset. positive.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue. positive.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years. negative.
When do we get to question him? negative.
What did you say? negative.
I can't let you do this... negative.
I... I don't understand. negative.
It's a hard place. negative.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times. positive.
Crime of passion. negative.
How should I know? positive.
No sir...pleasure. negative.
Dunno...Seems so. negative.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious... negative.

A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar... negative.
You've done a lot of growin'... negative.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy... negative.
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to... positive.
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own... positive.
Scar? negative.
But I just bought a good blanket. positive.
Cut it out, will ya... negative.
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo... negative.
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points. positive.

Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze... positive.
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die! negative.
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth! negative.
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones? negative.

Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on! negative.
Hi, darling. negative.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house! negative.

Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to... positive.

There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case. negative.

Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well. negative.

Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate? negative.
Fifty pounds? What for? negative.
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part. positive.

Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples! negative.

Does Tony ever tell you to do things? positive.
Do I have to? positive.
Thank you. negative.
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him. negative.
Fine. negative.
That's right, sir. negative.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady. negative.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream. negative.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did. positive.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now. negative.
Thank you for saying so. negative.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em! negative.
Good evening Mr. Torrance. negative.
Uh...huh. negative.
What time is it? negative.
Hmm, nice. negative.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy. negative.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then. negative.
Why? negative.
Put the bat down, Wendy. negative.
Go away. positive.
Wendy... negative.
I'm intrigued. negative.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat. negative.
Oh... negative.
Oh! negative.
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon? negative.
Fine. negative.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up. negative.
Will you? negative.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans. negative.
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day. negative.
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy. positive.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always. positive.
Yeah... sure. negative.
A tracer. You'll like it. negative.
What the hell does that matter? negative.
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town. positive.
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something. positive.
I told you! negative.
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy? negative.
Marty, the moon wasn't even full! negative.
But Uncle Al! You said- positive.
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on! negative.
Oh? negative.
What about crack?  You a user? negative.
What you say? negative.
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED negative.
SING! negative.
SING! negative.
With love. positive.
You can handle this. positive.
What did who say? negative.
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller. positive.
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint? positive.
Good evening, Vincent. negative.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours. negative.
Joey -- do it. negative.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican? positive.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom. negative.
I love my heddles.  Show me again. negative.
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers. positive.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place. positive.
Whatever. negative.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn! negative.
You know?  About me?  About everything? negative.
Five a.m.? negative.
Three years.  Sister. negative.
Excuse me? negative.
She won't?  Why not? negative.
What? negative.
Now you. negative.
Experience! negative.
Don't you know it! positive.
What is your full name?  Your Christian name? negative.
Enough joking. negative.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun! negative.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change positive.
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence. negative.
A what? negative.
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood? positive.
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor? negative.
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other. negative.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor? positive.
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event? negative.
What? negative.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote. positive.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us. negative.
I must go where I can be of use. negative.
Oh? negative.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion. negative.
He didn't do you a favor. negative.
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me! positive.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do? positive.
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch. negative.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival. positive.
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go. negative.
I think they'd understand. positive.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this. positive.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure. positive.
A hiding place. negative.
It's a bluff, Vince. negative.
Where is she? negative.
For like, twelve zillion eternities? positive.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp. positive.
However, we can also pray for other things. positive.
It's no use.  She just isn't here. positive.
She's our inspiration! negative.
Christy. negative.
She said they were from her old convent. negative.
But where? negative.
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need. negative.
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love? negative.
Many have. negative.
How did you hear this? negative.
I was afraid of this. positive.
What are you spying on? negative.
A diseased monster. negative.
... Brom Bones... negative.
Bring Young Masbath here. negative.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims. negative.
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today. negative.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God! negative.
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here. positive.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure. negative.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally? positive.
And now Jonathan Masbath. negative.
How could he? negative.
It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers. negative.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business. negative.
Listen. negative.
Should we go back? negative.
True enough. negative.
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths? negative.
In test... what? negative.
Baltus Van Tassel. negative.
Take the reins. negative.
I doubt that's the end. negative.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of... positive.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy. negative.
There is no such thing as magic. positive.
Yes, he does.  May I try? negative.
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable? negative.
I insist that you have it. negative.
They have done nothing of the sort. negative.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly. negative.
No, but... why do you ask that? negative.
What did you say? negative.
The skull is gone. negative.
And, what did he say? negative.
Keep climbing.  I will follow... negative.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical. positive.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him. negative.
Doctor, he is awake. negative.
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me? positive.
I can't remember. negative.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am. negative.
That boy wants me to. negative.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime. negative.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid. negative.
You have any biscuits for sale? positive.
What do you like to eat here? positive.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it? positive.
It's too big. negative.
Don't say nothin' about that boy. negative.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something. positive.
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back. positive.
Don't tell me what to do. negative.
It went real good. negative.
Would y'all like that? positive.
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be. negative.
I get nervous, that's all I know. negative.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune. negative.
I hate you! positive.
I know Albert. We're friends. positive.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand. positive.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you. positive.
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you. positive.
What numbers do you punch? negative.
I aim to kill you with it. positive.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter. negative.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank. negative.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon. positive.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though. positive.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her? positive.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye. negative.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you? negative.
Naw. negative.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me. negative.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard. positive.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do. positive.
Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg. negative.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me. negative.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right? negative.
Okay. negative.
He ain't ever okay to me. negative.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh? negative.
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama. positive.
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon. positive.
Me, too. negative.
I ain't got no boy. positive.
You better go get 'em. negative.
Naw. negative.
I never was no good with history. positive.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits. negative.
No ma'am. negative.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors. negative.
Ma'am? negative.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'. negative.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here. negative.
Not really to speak of. negative.
So, you're really going to stay here? negative.
How long have you been standing here? negative.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer. negative.
I know. positive.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass. positive.
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy. positive.
Vaughan, don't get pushy. negative.
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all? negative.
Yes sir. negative.
No thank you. negative.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all. negative.
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now. negative.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here. negative.
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction. negative.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities? negative.
That's the subject of my last chapter. positive.
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life. negative.
I'd love to. negative.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger? negative.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long. negative.
For me?  I'll have the same thing. negative.
The Queen of England? negative.
You run out of Schimmelpennincks? negative.
Yeah, I did. positive.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am. positive.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor. negative.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot. positive.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures. negative.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind? positive.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself? negative.
Not a peep. negative.
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time. negative.
Hi, Auggie. negative.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health. negative.
Ready. Any time you are. negative.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was. negative.
Anything for art, eh, Paul? negative.
You're looking good, Auggie. negative.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief. negative.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter. positive.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie. positive.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think? negative.
You don't give up, do you? negative.
Yeah, like what? negative.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves. negative.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around. positive.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business. positive.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke. negative.
Why don't you open it and find out? negative.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it. negative.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep. positive.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that. positive.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss. positive.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers. negative.
What is this, some kind of joke? negative.
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished. negative.
The refrigerator? negative.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas. negative.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents. positive.
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now. positive.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water? positive.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected? positive.
And you told your nephew about it? negative.
Those are pretty hostile words. positive.
Jesus. negative.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting. negative.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights. positive.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger. negative.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior. negative.
What do you want me to say? negative.
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack. negative.
That's okay. I've already had lunch. negative.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation. positive.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help. positive.
Is your father an artist? negative.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it? negative.
And how long did I tell you you could stay? positive.
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock. negative.
It looks like they've met in this apartment. positive.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open. negative.
What time did you get to bed last night? negative.
You work too hard, you know that? positive.
No way. positive.
The end. negative.
Is it yours? negative.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City. positive.
Oh, yeh? negative.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective. negative.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December... negative.
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it. positive.
Is that your third question? negative.
You done your math right. negative.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody. negative.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding. negative.
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does. negative.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff? negative.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news? negative.
Easy.  Slow is best. positive.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete. negative.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know. positive.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty... negative.
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip. positive.
And the next one...? negative.
And the last...? positive.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat. negative.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is? positive.
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist. negative.
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt. negative.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell. positive.
Yes. negative.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred. positive.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16. negative.
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland. negative.
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it. negative.
You're right.  I better use two. negative.
No, you don't. positive.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case. positive.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat. negative.
You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait. negative.
I should show them an American? negative.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real. negative.
I don't think so. positive.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that. negative.
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...? negative.
Sure, anything's poss... negative.
I already said that, b... negative.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death? negative.
He had no reason to. negative.
That's all he said. negative.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4. negative.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"? negative.
All right, girls - from the top again. negative.
Funny?  In what way? negative.
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory. negative.
It's private.  Go away. positive.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying. negative.
I'll say. positive.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water! negative.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats! negative.
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock. negative.
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me. positive.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave. negative.
But this is so humiliating. negative.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar. negative.
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate. negative.
Daphne, you're bothering us. negative.
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht - positive.
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee. positive.
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding. negative.
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time! negative.
Security. negative.
Like what? negative.
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back. positive.
Daphne got a proposal tonight. positive.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg. negative.
Get me Room 414. negative.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye. negative.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet. negative.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood. negative.
I'm Sugar Cane. negative.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away. positive.
If there's anything I can do for you - positive.
Interesting. negative.
That's ridiculous. negative.
What did you say? negative.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something. positive.
I have a very low resistance. positive.
You got some? negative.
Or was it Bryn Mawr? positive.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first. positive.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine. negative.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face - positive.
Oh yes, we do! negative.
I guess she's not in here. negative.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing. positive.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones - positive.
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue. negative.
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through - negative.
Me too.  Bye now. negative.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart? negative.
Most of the time I slap it. negative.
Wanna bet? negative.
Goodbye? negative.
No, thank you.  I'll walk. negative.
I'll throw up! negative.
Who? negative.
Pleased to meet you. negative.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all. negative.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde. negative.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry. positive.
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it? negative.
It's not the backs that worry me. negative.
You two from the Poliakoff Agency? positive.
No - funerals. positive.
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you? negative.
Oh. negative.
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop. negative.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble. negative.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses - positive.
Just my feminine intuition. positive.
My fault. negative.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view. negative.
Up, up, up. negative.
Could be.  Do you play the market? positive.
I beg your pardon? negative.
It's been delightful meeting you both. negative.
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht. negative.
Shells?  Whatever for? negative.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this. positive.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line. positive.
I don't mind if I do. negative.
Completely. negative.
You're flattering me. negative.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless. negative.
That makes me feel just awful. negative.
You mean you can't fall in love? negative.
What happened? negative.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry. negative.
Good morning. positive.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve. negative.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away. negative.
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present. negative.
I know.  Every time! positive.
Go where? negative.
I never join nothin'. negative.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time? negative.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer. negative.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida? negative.
Big joke! negative.
Why? negative.
Goodbye, Charlie. negative.
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you? negative.
Except its Scotch. negative.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it. positive.
What? Why? What do you mean? negative.
Hey. negative.
Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives. negative.
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnt outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnt feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I dont know, but your misery just isnt working for me anymore. positive.
Actually, I do. negative.
Or Kat.... positive.
Oh, dont be that way. negative.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow. negative.
Oh, hello. negative.
What? negative.
Yeah? positive.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me. negative.
When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough. negative.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise. negative.
Kat. negative.
I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked. positive.
Youre too good for him. negative.
A weekend? negative.
Thats right. Imagine facing it alone. negative.
This happened to you? positive.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me. positive.
Show me. negative.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure. negative.
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not. positive.
Make out with you for free. negative.
Yeah. positive.
I didnt say he was worth it. negative.
Hi. negative.
I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself. positive.
Therapist. negative.
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely. negative.
Its complicated, Dad. negative.
Is there any other way to take it? negative.
--and The ass of The man who adores her. negative.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you. negative.
Uh huh... negative.
That's where we come from first? negative.
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game -- negative.
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong! negative.
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him. negative.
Yes, sir... negative.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher. positive.
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more! negative.
My father taught me... negative.
Sausage and hambones! negative.
That's right! negative.
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school. negative.
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long. negative.
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time. negative.
You sure can, son... negative.
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble! positive.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed. negative.
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field? negative.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot. negative.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. . negative.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay! negative.
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here. positive.
Might be... negative.
Ike, you could make a song outta that! negative.
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'! positive.
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee! negative.
Will they give him a trial? positive.
There are more important matters right now... negative.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage- positive.
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much. negative.
Eric! negative.
How would you like to go to the principal's office? negative.
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak. positive.
Very funny! negative.
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman! positive.
We're going... Let's run through the plan!! negative.
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that. positive.
Oh. negative.
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!? negative.
What? negative.
And she's getting worse... positive.
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame... negative.
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!! negative.
Whoops. negative.
Mph rmprmmh rm!! negative.
What the hell are you guys doing here? negative.
Mom... When is the war gonna be over? negative.
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off. negative.
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you. negative.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie. negative.
Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases! negative.
It's... It's not good children. negative.
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time. negative.
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting! negative.

KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!! positive.
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance. negative.
Uhh... Bacon. negative.
Yeah, I guess. negative.
What's a dying giraffe sound like? positive.
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!! positive.
She's not my girlfriend, dude! negative.
Our moms suck! negative.
How do we do that? negative.
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva? negative.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman? negative.
Are you sure, Kenny? negative.
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal. negative.
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or- negative.
What is 'fisting'? negative.
Oh. negative.
No, it was worse than that... negative.
What is Terrance and Phillip? negative.
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to! negative.
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master? negative.
You bet, Terrance! negative.
Hello, Brooke Shields! negative.
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US? negative.
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time. positive.
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank! negative.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you? negative.
I know. positive.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart. positive.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that? negative.
You didn't? negative.
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b> positive.
You're Warren Wayne. negative.
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it. negative.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much. positive.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work. negative.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there? positive.
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here. positive.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine. negative.
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it? negative.
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon. positive.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson! negative.
Wait. negative.
Sure. negative.
Why?  Where are you going? negative.
You too. negative.
Taylor!  Where are you? negative.
Barnes? negative.
How does the distress signal look? negative.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry. negative.
Over and out. negative.
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry! negative.
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that. positive.
Is there anything I can help you with? positive.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar. negative.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods! positive.
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing? negative.
Are you nuts!  It's too risky! negative.
Baby, take it easy. negative.
Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose. positive.
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations. positive.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently. negative.
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers. negative.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations. positive.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand. negative.
He's my dad. negative.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one. negative.
You afraid we're gonna steal it? negative.
Are you guys bruddas? negative.
You listen to the feelings, not the words. negative.
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you. negative.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze. positive.
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt. positive.
They suspended me for 100 years. negative.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king. negative.
Thanks. negative.
Grace Skinner. negative.
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find. negative.
I got a right. You're my father. negative.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies. negative.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan. positive.
I'm getting to like it here. negative.
I gotta survive. negative.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo. negative.
See ya 'round Maynard. negative.
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out. negative.
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late. positive.
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes. negative.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. negative.
Junior who? negative.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite. negative.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day. positive.
What ever happened to just bowling? negative.
Why would you help me? negative.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior. negative.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand. negative.
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it. positive.
Yippy! negative.
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be? negative.
Where can I find him? negative.
No, not at all. negative.
No. Do You? positive.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do. positive.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo. negative.
I could let them go for ten. negative.
You got any broken bones? positive.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable. negative.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else. positive.
It? negative.
I feel sick. negative.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel. negative.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again. positive.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me. negative.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word? negative.
What about plan C? negative.
I'm not here to bowl. negative.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz. negative.
Dwarf bowling's illegal. negative.
Open it, Captain! negative.
Fletcher, I want you back here. negative.
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet. positive.
How about I just press the button? positive.
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs? negative.
How long will that be? negative.
But she's -- positive.
Forty yards. negative.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat. negative.
What team? negative.
Nothing else. negative.
From what?  What's with all the security? negative.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you? positive.
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago. negative.
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old. negative.
It doesn't make any sense. negative.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it? negative.
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life. positive.
What's wrong with oxygen? positive.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say. negative.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you. negative.
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response. positive.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier. positive.
Pull it. negative.
Nothing, sir. negative.
What the hell is going on here? negative.
They've left, keep watching! negative.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash? negative.
What? negative.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it. positive.
How do you mean, strange? negative.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside. negative.
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction. negative.
Radiation shield, you think? positive.
What do you make of this? negative.
Too big? negative.
What sub? negative.
What -- are you threatening me? negative.
Yeah.  Drowning. positive.
Get this thing off me. negative.
What? negative.
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back. negative.
You went through Edmunds' things? negative.
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay? positive.
You did, didn't you? negative.
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle. negative.
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman... negative.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me. negative.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any. positive.
Manifested? negative.
What? negative.
Which I told Barnes was attacking -- negative.
But why is he doing it? negative.
Bingo. negative.
Antibiotic. negative.
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... " negative.
I'll just boost the doses. positive.
Beth -- negative.
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore. negative.
I'm feeling better. negative.
You think I'd really drink that? negative.
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified. negative.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that. negative.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it? negative.
But I have to, Norman. positive.
It's not safe for you to be either. negative.
Get away from the door, Beth. negative.
Don't you know? positive.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it. negative.
C'mon -- negative.
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman? negative.
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts. positive.
Who says it's a he? negative.
In time for what? negative.
Just in time for what? negative.
Like what?  I'm not -- negative.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible. positive.
What noise? negative.
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here. positive.
Page 87 of what, Harry? negative.
What are they? negative.
What happened to her? negative.
You know what it is, Harry. positive.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub. negative.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just -- negative.
Shut up and catch. negative.
No idea. negative.
Wait! negative.
You mean forget? negative.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering. negative.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes? negative.
Think about it. positive.
Meaning? negative.
Please.  It must have flown here -- negative.
"We are friends". negative.
The others, sir? negative.
What report? negative.
Geologists?  At a plane crash? positive.
Like what? negative.
You mean a picture? negative.
Why's that? negative.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey -- negative.
What? negative.
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition. negative.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now? positive.
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system. negative.
This isn't a game, you know. positive.
Fear is their greatest weapon. negative.
Not bad. negative.
We'll be back before you are, old man. positive.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father... positive.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility! positive.
You mean I generate an energy field? negative.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help. positive.
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it. positive.
He's bluffing... negative.
All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either. negative.
He can't find Organa Major. negative.
You mean we should go after her!... positive.
You look great!  The uniform and everything! negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
Was this trip really necessary? negative.
What are you saying? negative.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker. positive.
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away. negative.
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me! positive.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste... positive.
He'll be well cared for. positive.
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here... positive.
I read you sir. negative.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems. negative.
I'd consider it an honor. negative.
What an honor... negative.
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...! negative.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys ! negative.
What do I want with a scar ? positive.
I didn't see him ! negative.
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers. negative.
Sir, no, sir. negative.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal. negative.
Ace of spades. negative.
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get... negative.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet. negative.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with. positive.
Zander, please... Let's go ! negative.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming ! negative.
Who ? negative.
I have good reflexes. negative.
I'll meet you outside. negative.
Shhh... negative.
He left this morning. He couldn't say where. negative.
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ? positive.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet ! negative.
I like it. It's kinda...you. positive.
How are you, Carl ? negative.
Ibanez...LET'S GO ! negative.
Hut... hut ! negative.
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ? negative.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen... negative.
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start. negative.
How come we never got together ? negative.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted. negative.
I'm on it ! negative.
All bands. negative.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it. negative.
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there. positive.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile. positive.
Sir, thank you, sir ! negative.
Sir, yes, sir ! negative.
Courage, I guess. negative.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid... positive.
You can never be sure. negative.
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke. positive.
What is it, Rico ? negative.
Yes, sir ! negative.
Cover us, Ace ! negative.
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise. positive.
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator. positive.
That is how V'ger will survive. negative.
By the Creator. negative.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect... positive.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator. negative.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>... positive.
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator! positive.
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do. positive.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive. negative.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off. negative.
I'm aware of that, sir. negative.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission. negative.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications. negative.
It's taken control of the computer...! negative.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve! negative.
Captain... I'd like to go along... negative.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic. negative.
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image. negative.
A tractor beam... negative.
We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves. negative.
Ten seconds.... negative.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir. negative.
Hold relative position here... negative.
Thrusters ahead, one third. negative.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott? negative.
See that it is.  Take me over, please. negative.
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.' positive.
I want him here.  Sit down! negative.
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain. positive.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you... negative.
Any reply from them? negative.
Our... 'insignificance'? positive.
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot -- negative.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely. positive.
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information. negative.

Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true? positive.

Got a lot of homework? negative.
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby. positive.
Fine. negative.

What the hell is it, anyhow? negative.
What! negative.
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for. negative.
Excellent...excellent! negative.
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that? positive.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile. negative.
If I don't get power up we are! negative.
What does that mean? negative.

I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative. negative.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon. negative.
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand. negative.
I know nothing of the sort! positive.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this? negative.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador. negative.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here. positive.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it. positive.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically. negative.
See!  See, I told you. negative.
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi. positive.
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T... negative.
What? negative.
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he? negative.
Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me. negative.
What did you say? negative.
General Schmuck? negative.
What kind of trouble? negative.
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to -- negative.
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure. negative.
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies. negative.
This is General Ripper speaking. positive.
You're right, sir. negative.
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so. negative.
No, sir. negative.

General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter. positive.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir. negative.
That's right, Major. negative.
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it? positive.
Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast. negative.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war? negative.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops. negative.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament? negative.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see? positive.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world. negative.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can. negative.
Why can't you cancel it? negative.
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is. positive.
Admiral Buldike? negative.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine --- negative.
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall. negative.
Roger. One-three-eight. negative.
Maybe it's an exercise. negative.
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace. negative.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles. positive.
Speed? negative.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him? positive.
I think they mean business. positive.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right. negative.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM? negative.
Forget it. negative.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right? negative.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first. positive.
In the back...feels like an arrowhead. negative.
Hell, he looks dead. negative.
Quentin, how's your gear? negative.
Recall what mistake? negative.
Why should they call us back? negative.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour. negative.
Like hell it does. positive.
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code. negative.
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense. negative.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball. negative.
But I get a red light. negative.
Let me check. negative.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar. negative.
But who would be chosen? positive.
Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck. positive.

No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him? positive.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing. positive.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay. negative.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls. negative.
And your mom. negative.
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea. positive.
That's the rock star thing. negative.
You wanna bet he's with a girl? negative.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk. positive.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it! negative.
Okay, okay. negative.
No. negative.
No, no, I wasn't trying. negative.

Wait, what happened to the tree? negative.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist. negative.
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off! negative.
In what way? negative.
I'm so burnt-out. negative.
Glad it's okay. negative.
Good. See you later. positive.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay. negative.
No, no, whoa! negative.
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here. negative.
I could. negative.
Yes! negative.
I didn't want to eat this much, man. positive.
Okay. negative.
Let's see. positive.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff. positive.
We were? negative.
Funny shit, man. negative.
Pony and I are friends. positive.
He causes problems. He was here earlier. positive.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much. positive.
Because I'm alienated. negative.
Sooze wants to see him. negative.
Ask your girlfriend. negative.
No. negative.
I hit her. negative.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless. positive.

Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York? negative.
Us. negative.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine? negative.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all. positive.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here. negative.
I, yeah. positive.
Well, what about us? negative.
Oh, no, no, no. negative.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out. negative.

We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah. negative.
Yeah, really. negative.
Well, not exactly. negative.
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier. positive.

Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really... negative.

Come on, Jeff. negative.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze. negative.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough. negative.
No car. negative.
You know the fuck not. negative.
Wayne Gretzky. negative.

Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom! positive.
He Ikea'd us. negative.
I guess there's an exception to every rule. negative.
You're kidding. negative.

Or, I could get my own horse... negative.
Oh yeah, you caught us... negative.
Thanks!  That'd be great. negative.

Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O." negative.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?! negative.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!" negative.
Bank branch! negative.
Now how the hell can I help you? negative.
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere! positive.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too? negative.
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in. negative.
I didn't mean to -- positive.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go. positive.
In a deep freeze. negative.
Where's the bar? negative.
Thanks. negative.
As for instance? negative.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower? negative.
You don't know how glad I am to see youl positive.
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately. negative.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news? negative.
I tell you this is half sold. positive.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind. negative.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ... negative.
I'll make it short. negative.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town. negative.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place. negative.
You're tough, all right. negative.
It will? negative.
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous. negative.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script. negative.
Nice job. negative.
It must be my new shampoo. negative.
This is where you live? negative.
Whose house is it? negative.
Hello, Mr. deMille. negative.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in. positive.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it. negative.
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me. positive.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license. positive.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat. positive.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc. negative.

Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary. positive.

Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out. negative.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy? negative.
Who? negative.
This is the right day. negative.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star. negative.
They're awful.  They make me cough. negative.

It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next. positive.
Yes, Norma. negative.
Why do you say that? negative.
Dressed for what? negative.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing? negative.
Good. negative.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements. positive.
She is upstairs. negative.
Right with you. negative.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid. negative.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching. negative.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed. positive.
That's right. negative.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award. positive.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue. negative.
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before? positive.
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside. negative.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me! negative.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up. negative.
The cameras have arrived, Madame. negative.
But where? negative.
What is it? negative.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near . negative.

You can't just abandon me.  Alone. positive.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you? negative.
But why? negative.
Are you asking me for a "date"? negative.
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source. positive.
Do you want to come to Argo City? positive.
I did. negative.
I don't want your help. negative.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest! negative.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants. negative.
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch. positive.
She's a beast. negative.
Must've been a defective puck. negative.
You sure? negative.
It doesn't seem right. positive.
Somebody's gotta do something!! positive.
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D. negative.
He's nice. negative.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot. negative.
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here. negative.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over. negative.
Throw him out. negative.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night. negative.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft. positive.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door. positive.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone. negative.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time. negative.
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think. positive.
Going to try. Didn't say I could. negative.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school? negative.
Nope.  Never. negative.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad. positive.
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent. negative.
There's a lot of choices here. negative.
No, thanks. negative.
Call me. negative.
Can I help? negative.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day. negative.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful. positive.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story! positive.
Mom and I do this all the time. positive.
Sure. negative.
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem. negative.
Oh? negative.
Nope, but -- positive.
I know, I'm the fault. negative.
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65. negative.

Couldn't we just get a computer to do this? positive.
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow. positive.
Hello. negative.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands. negative.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more. negative.
Don't cry, Bubba. negative.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze? negative.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says. positive.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed? positive.
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool -- positive.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening. negative.
Say you love me. negative.
Let's get you inside . . . . negative.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . . positive.
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen. negative.
Oh, hi. negative.

That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of -- negative.

There is some good in you, Lex, after all. negative.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time. negative.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here? positive.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius. positive.
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group. positive.
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan. positive.
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance? positive.
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton. negative.
I didn't ask her anything . . . negative.
I want my Liberace record back tonight. negative.
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off. negative.
Constantly. negative.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this -- negative.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it. positive.
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . . negative.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . . negative.
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have. negative.
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers! negative.
Yes? negative.
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own. negative.
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty. negative.

Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom. negative.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species. negative.

If you say so. Here goes. negative.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony. negative.
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash. negative.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen. negative.
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back? positive.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea. positive.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet. negative.
I'm sorry. negative.
N-no...I mean...you bet. negative.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see. positive.
Daddy . . . ? negative.
Who? negative.
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . . negative.
Our other dinner guest. negative.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story. negative.
A toupee that flies? negative.
Get the box, nephew. negative.
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last. positive.
Ready, Uncle Lex? negative.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan. negative.
Destiny. negative.
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block. negative.
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun! negative.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world. positive.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive. positive.
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back. negative.
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy. negative.
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part! negative.
What's she doing in California? negative.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board. negative.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws. positive.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some? negative.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor. negative.
Okay.  Take me to your leader. negative.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land." positive.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire. negative.
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it? negative.
First the pets, Otis. positive.
Fifty degrees below and still falling. negative.
Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed. positive.
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose. negative.
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  -- negative.
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection! negative.
If you persist, you leave us no choice. negative.
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton. negative.
What's your name, boy? negative.
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane. positive.
Right on the first guess. negative.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed? negative.
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me. positive.
You think they're strange? negative.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law. negative.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force. negative.
Pink. negative.
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for? positive.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor. positive.
I...uh...check. negative.
Otis... negative.
It is for me. negative.
Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it... negative.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember? negative.
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip! negative.
We'll see how fast I can fly. negative.
How are you? negative.
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife. negative.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe? negative.
Are you still in touch? positive.
Alison. negative.
Mister, I don't want to know your name. positive.
No you don't. positive.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you. positive.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight. negative.
I'm not sure. negative.
How? negative.
C'mon, you know that won't... positive.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did. negative.
A while. negative.
You believe that? negative.
Well I don't. positive.
From what? negative.
You talked about it? negative.
Berry-picking. negative.
And what's that? negative.
You mentioned that he had a learning disability. negative.
That would complicate things. positive.
I did. negative.
Hi, Dolores. negative.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies. positive.
That's what he said. negative.
Oh. negative.
The people in the town? positive.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last. negative.
Thank you, Nicole. negative.
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle... negative.
There's the Prescots... negative.
Tell me about it. negative.
Daddy? negative.
Don't you want to hear? negative.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer. positive.
I need money. negative.
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too. negative.
What is it? negative.
Excuse me? negative.
No. negative.
Do you have this agreement with you? positive.
Yes. negative.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly. positive.
Positive. negative.
No. negative.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed. positive.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital. negative.
It's okay. negative.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away. negative.
As opposed to this T.V.? positive.
Yeah, right. positive.
Thanks, I see him... negative.
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives! negative.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl... negative.
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis? positive.
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her... positive.
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace! negative.
Who said Sidney? negative.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive? negative.
I have a message from your sister. negative.
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis. negative.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat. negative.
I'll listen one more minute. negative.
Are you finished? negative.
When? negative.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas. negative.
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity". negative.
But not for anything I did today... negative.
The man in jail is always for freedom. positive.
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that... negative.
Talk to her yourself... negative.
You're incapable of the truth... negative.
Go out with DIFFERENT girls! negative.
What about? negative.
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...? positive.
You're sure.  Find out for me. negative.
...cigarette girls... And naturally - negative.
In his apartment - negative.
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning! negative.
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe... negative.
Nothing I didn't think of you before. positive.
I'm used to you... negative.
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here - positive.
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?! positive.
Temple, I caught your act the other night and - negative.
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other. negative.
Yes, but why? negative.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family - negative.
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic. negative.
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now... positive.
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow? negative.
Steve, stop it please... negative.
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things... positive.
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that. positive.
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie... negative.
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one... negative.
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,, negative.
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!! negative.
Now listen to me very carefully. negative.
My mission is to protect you. negative.
Of course.  I'm a terminator. negative.
Why? negative.
Why? negative.
Cool. negative.
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain. negative.
No. negative.
Terminated. negative.
I order you not to! negative.
Alright, it!  We need it! positive.
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will. negative.
Go!  I'll finish here. positive.
SHOOT!!!! negative.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff... positive.
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move! negative.
Open the goddamn door! negative.
Why him? negative.
Son of a bitch, I knew it! negative.
Yes. negative.
Relax now, Sarah -- negative.
I don't know. positive.
But I promised your mother. negative.

And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them. negative.
I'm Steve. What's your name? negative.
and totally irrelevant. negative.
With more what? More what? positive.
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters. negative.
I have a duty. negative.
Yes. negative.
Yes. negative.
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too. negative.
Do you know where the Adagio begins? positive.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember. positive.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies. positive.
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving. negative.
I wasn't told. I just knew it. positive.
And what was that? negative.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.' positive.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it. positive.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for? negative.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad. negative.
What? negative.
Those attitudes do not exist in me. negative.
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them. negative.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist. positive.
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth. negative.
Do you know Hans Hinkel? positive.
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it? negative.
How could I forget? positive.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case. negative.
So. You wanted to see me. negative.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one? negative.
Yeah? positive.
His private life? negative.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday. positive.
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate. negative.
Jeez, and I never heard of him. negative.
Right. Claims assessor. negative.
Come to the office, please. negative.
You're late. negative.
Alright! negative.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range... negative.
All. negative.
Wrong. negative.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor. negative.
I hate the beige one. positive.
That's none of your business. negative.
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead. positive.
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war... positive.
I volunteered. negative.
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war. positive.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it. positive.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this. negative.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid. negative.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you. positive.
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us. negative.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed... negative.
No.  Never. negative.
It's better that way. negative.
Ticklish? negative.

You want company? negative.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim. negative.

Test it. negative.
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken. positive.

Nell, what do we do? negative.
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you. negative.
I don't know what you mean. positive.
That's why we're here. negative.

What'd you call that -- the Protector? negative.
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that. positive.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine. positive.

Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they. positive.
She didn't write to me, did she. negative.

Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know. positive.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg. negative.

Five thousand. negative.
Good luck. negative.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation. negative.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job. negative.
What do you think? positive.
What are you doing here? negative.
You know I don't live with him. positive.
Who's looking for you? negative.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple. negative.
Tell me. positive.
Yes. Thank you. negative.
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again. negative.
We've certainly missed you. negative.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff. negative.
Geez, Mr Crane. negative.

Honey? negative.
Honey... negative.
How are you? negative.
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider. positive.

Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth. negative.
I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave... negative.
He a good man? negative.
So, who should I-- negative.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas. negative.
I know who you are, Mr Crane. negative.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie... positive.
Uh-huh. negative.
Huh? negative.
Whuddya mean? negative.
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Uh-huh. negative.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail. negative.

We're just closing, friend. negative.
Ah. negative.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here. negative.
It better be good. negative.
I'm in. negative.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug. positive.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert! negative.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block. negative.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that. negative.
Let's go! negative.
Hurry up! negative.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while... negative.
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works. negative.
So the method of death is the only connection? negative.
You're kidding. negative.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard? negative.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster. negative.
The sub-basement? negative.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone. negative.
Pardon my French, but bull shit. positive.
Oh shit. negative.
I'd say we're in its home. negative.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here. negative.
What are they? negative.
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock. negative.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight? negative.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't. negative.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel. negative.
I wouldn't be so sure. negative.
Not really.  Just the sub-basement. negative.

Yes, I do. positive.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class. negative.

He's right.  Follow me. negative.
What kind of hormones? negative.
How about lunch? negative.
Maybe not. negative.
And John? negative.
I don't understand. negative.
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw. negative.
Would you mind showing it to me? negative.
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one. negative.
Where did you see it? negative.
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something. positive.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours. negative.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating. negative.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here. negative.
The planetarium! negative.
I think... it means it's full. positive.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones. negative.
I think... for the pleasure of the kill. positive.
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display. negative.
Today. negative.
He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep. negative.
He gave it back to his father. negative.
It has to be the reality. negative.
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps? negative.
Certainly a nomination. negative.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up. positive.
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch. negative.
It's not gonna be his, you idiot. negative.
You think she'd go through with it? positive.
That's right.  Lauren. negative.
Now. negative.
If we don't go now, it won't happen. negative.
Yeah?  Outta what? negative.
Yeah, what happened? negative.
Are you okay?  You look like shit. positive.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody? negative.
What's that? negative.
It's a surprise. negative.
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on. negative.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure? negative.
I made macaroni. negative.
I still want to look over a couple of things. positive.

You blaming me for the traffic? negative.
I think I'd like a little company. positive.
Do something... negative.
--Truman, you're gonna be late! positive.
Well, I made it through another night. negative.
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow-- negative.
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there. positive.
There's no one here. negative.
--How do you know about that? negative.
I don't understand. negative.
Yeah. positive.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate. negative.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted. negative.

Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover. negative.

Incinerate it. Like the others. positive.
There are complications. positive.
You got some kind of business with him? negative.
No. Don't bother. positive.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington. negative.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that. negative.
Yeah, I did. positive.
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight. negative.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict. positive.
They want to discredit you -- for what? negative.
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins. negative.

You can't. negative.
I've been using you?! negative.
I told you -- he and I were old friends -- negative.
Did you find something? positive.
I think they have that covered. positive.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully? negative.
I'm in the vending room. negative.

I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment... negative.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous. negative.
Mulder -- negative.
I've got a hearing tomorrow -- negative.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen. negative.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed. negative.
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong. positive.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks. negative.
Mulder -- negative.
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end -- negative.
Yeah...? positive.
I need you on this, Scully -- positive.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win. positive.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel. negative.
Thank you. negative.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing -- negative.
I'm not taking any chances. negative.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours. negative.
What do you mean, walked? negative.
What about you? negative.

Okay. negative.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia. negative.
I'll be fine. negative.
Give a kiss to Edward. negative.
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it. negative.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human. negative.
Then what is he? negative.
I can't leave him! negative.
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine. negative.
It doesn't matter... negative.
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter. positive.
You're kidding me. negative.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared. negative.
Initiating connection. negative.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry. negative.
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights. negative.
Yes. negative.
Awaiting his arrival. negative.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking. negative.

He's safe in the Russian zone. negative.
His. negative.

Oh, really? negative.
No. negative.
Oh, yeah... negative.
That's stupid. negative.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief. negative.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah. positive.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed. positive.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter. negative.
Lina, come here! negative.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat. negative.

Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls. negative.
People say that? positive.

It's my apartment. negative.
Again? negative.
No.  I'm just depressed. negative.
Of course, that's what they're for. negative.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide. negative.
Yes... It's magic. negative.
But... how is he going to breathe? negative.

Please, call me Mordechai. negative.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of. positive.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would. negative.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move. negative.
Mordechai! negative.
We go to the same temple. negative.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery? negative.
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays. negative.
Happy Hanukkah Morty. negative.
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz. negative.
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist. negative.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up. negative.
Oh yeah. Take a look. positive.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget. negative.
Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls. negative.

You found the leopard! negative.
Who? negative.
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times -- positive.
Rosita  I have wondered - negative.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings. negative.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey. negative.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man! positive.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit? negative.
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard   Don't you? positive.

Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time. negative.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other? positive.
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you? negative.

And I suppose you don't feel bad! negative.
The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night  positive.
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you. negative.
I know. Funerals. positive.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us. positive.
You're positive of that, aren't you? negative.

Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family. negative.
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I. negative.
That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter. positive.
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir. negative.
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know. negative.
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble. negative.
Disney! How inter... negative.
You... You found that at Leons? positive.
Excuse me? negative.
Excuse me? negative.
Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job? negative.

No! negative.
Leon hung himself. negative.
Leon hung himself... negative.
You dont say. positive.

Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471. negative.
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents. negative.
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England. positive.
Yeah. positive.
No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition. negative.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily. positive.
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late. positive.
Its up to you whether they walk or not. negative.
This is a bad line. negative.

May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard? negative.
Recommended? negative.
Do what, Mr Lombard? negative.
Shut up and drive! negative.
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and were out of business. negative.
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans... negative.
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He... negative.
I dont recollect mentioning a friend. negative.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his... negative.
Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave. negative.
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My fingers on the trigger, you hear! negative.
My sister... She lives in the next valley. positive.
Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you. negative.
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still... negative.
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know... negative.
No... negative.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you... negative.
Uh-huh. negative.
I know his work better than I know him. positive.
Could that be Camden Market? negative.
Eh bien... Tes sûr que tas besoin de moi?  La petite ma lair assez bien foutue, non? negative.
Alors quoi? negative.
If you can, send me a receipt. negative.
Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck? negative.
Its a good guess... negative.
Cost what? negative.
Whats that? A word? negative.
I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh? positive.
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha... negative.
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if... negative.
Very generous of you all.  How much? positive.
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat! negative.
Now? negative.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it. positive.
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks. negative.
Uh... they said... they will think about it. positive.
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow. positive.
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone... negative.
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months... positive.
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop? negative.
Sound the retreat... positive.
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner... negative.
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this? negative.
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone? negative.
No no, I'm fine, really... negative.
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy. negative.
Yes. negative.
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed... negative.
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer? negative.
You really think she's been sent... by God? positive.
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that... negative.
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"... negative.
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion? negative.
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me? negative.
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you... positive.
That's not a lot. negative.
I know... positive.
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever! negative.
Damn right! negative.
No good?  This is a disaster! negative.
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger. negative.
Perfectly. negative.
No... not like this... negative.
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me? negative.
No! negative.
Nothing... just taking his teeth. negative.
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause! positive.
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already? negative.
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up! negative.
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory! negative.
A few teeth... that's the price of his life? negative.
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say? positive.
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one... positive.
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of? negative.
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?" positive.
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here... negative.
What do you mean, they won't come? negative.
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me... positive.
Do you think this cross will protect you? positive.
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul. negative.
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore. negative.
Are you willing to follow all His commandments? negative.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her? positive.
Jeanne, be patient. negative.
Who wants me to stop? negative.
Oh, yes. I remember. negative.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful. positive.
Wladek, please. negative.
Wladek, please. negative.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself. negative.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz. negative.
He'll be back before curfew. positive.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them? negative.
What? negative.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me! negative.
It costs. negative.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance.. negative.
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean... positive.
Yes, please. negative.
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back. negative.
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them! negative.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food! negative.
They were taking you away. positive.
There are always notices going up. positive.
Not this week. negative.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East? positive.
Wladek! How are you? negative.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean. positive.
Cow! negative.
I was listening, Kitten. negative.
You made contact? negative.
Out of Warsaw. Where? negative.
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks. negative.
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks. negative.
We're getting out. negative.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over? negative.
Like it were a piano? positive.
No sound at all? positive.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better. negative.
She's stunted, that's one thing. positive.
Someone died here. It's tapu. negative.
The piano. negative.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it. negative.
You mean in signs? negative.
It must come. negative.
Hello. negative.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here! negative.
Who told ya this guy was in here? negative.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name. positive.
Billie.  You ready? negative.
Don't worry about it, pal. negative.
I had some appointments. negative.
All of it. negative.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that? positive.
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way. negative.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much. negative.
Forget it. negative.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it. positive.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's. positive.
Who's got the contract? negative.
What do ya want the others to get? negative.
You sober? negative.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened? negative.
You mean you blew it. negative.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it. positive.
If we ever get to it. negative.
No, not a thing. negative.
I thought I'd lost him. negative.
It was too noisy. negative.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long. negative.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways. negative.
The wire is ten years outa date. negative.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever. negative.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck? positive.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money. negative.
What for?  I haven't done anything. negative.
Where's June today? negative.
2:00 A.M. negative.
He'd like to kill me. negative.
How ya doin', Jimmy. negative.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now. negative.
Then why the rat? negative.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time. positive.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got. positive.
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring. positive.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya. positive.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second. negative.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them. positive.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper. negative.
You know how they are... sex... negative.
Don't cry. negative.
Go! negative.
You're high enough. negative.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you. negative.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money. negative.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab. negative.
He's waiting for you. negative.
He wouldn't say. positive.
Yes. negative.
Disappeared! negative.
Macaulay. negative.
Which way did she fall? negative.
I bought it in a pawn shop. negative.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - positive.
You see how much we have to say. negative.
Yes, she would. positive.
What would your mother say to that? negative.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas. negative.
Better get home before it is. negative.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope? negative.
Man to man, I'm not. negative.
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know? negative.
Who's your candidate? negative.
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go. negative.
Let's go and see.  Taxi! positive.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes. negative.
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is. negative.
Fifty will still get you a hundred. negative.
Rosebreen. negative.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him. positive.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail... negative.
--was Wynant's. negative.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars. negative.
Did you go? negative.
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again. negative.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us. positive.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop. negative.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money. positive.
All right.  All right. negative.
Don't you remember.... negative.
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ... negative.
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going. positive.
Never mind. negative.
No. negative.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't! positive.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding? negative.
No word at all? negative.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them. negative.
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him? positive.
They'll want more than your word for that. negative.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up. negative.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash - positive.
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it? negative.
Oh, this is Andy -- negative.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side. positive.
Six Martinis. negative.
That's jolly. negative.
Can't you get to sleep? negative.
Maybe a drink would help you. negative.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind? negative.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right? negative.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta! positive.
Well, didn't you? negative.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice. negative.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys. negative.
Come on, Watson, we're going places. negative.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk. negative.
Looks like a hold-up! positive.
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up. negative.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out. positive.
Say you're the one who got me in this! positive.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied. negative.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat? positive.
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee. negative.
Couple of months anyway. negative.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked. negative.
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him? negative.
Mimi... negative.
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy. negative.
I don't know. positive.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off. negative.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's. negative.
Yes.  Nick! negative.
Baghdad. negative.
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait. negative.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school. negative.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is. negative.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on! negative.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks. negative.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces. positive.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now. negative.
I heard! negative.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share. negative.
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed? negative.
I told you; don't push me around. positive.
We're at war. negative.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need. negative.
What if I do? negative.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand. negative.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing? negative.
No you're not. negative.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with. negative.
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires! negative.
Millionaires, man. negative.
Faster we get there, faster we get back. negative.
Me and Wes are just going to talk. negative.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up. negative.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran. negative.
I hope it means something, otherwise... negative.
Stay low. negative.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about. positive.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it. negative.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon. positive.
Jesus, Jaeger. negative.
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself. negative.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long. negative.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas. negative.
Is it all right if I stand up? negative.
Sure. negative.
Okay.  Then we go this way. negative.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here. negative.

Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid. positive.
The...the gold... negative.
When did you make the switch? negative.
Somebody has to. positive.
Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier. negative.
He's going to slow down. negative.
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal? negative.
I could use some recon photos too. negative.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally. negative.
Yeah, you're funny. negative.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open. positive.
What? negative.

Yes! negative.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss. negative.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you. positive.
I know you're a pussy.  I know that. positive.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us. positive.

But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. positive.
He got it, Woody! negative.
Yes SIR! negative.
Uh-oh. negative.
Right here, Woody! negative.
Got it. negative.
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake. negative.
Speed up! negative.
Slink!  Hang on! negative.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids. positive.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet. negative.
Home is where the heart is. negative.
I finished it off. negative.
So did I. negative.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen. negative.
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this. positive.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money. negative.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money? negative.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed. negative.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers. positive.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship -- positive.
What? negative.
I was just waiting for the right time. negative.
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed. negative.
That's frustrating. negative.
Why? negative.
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank -- negative.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front. positive.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different. negative.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia. negative.
I don't know. positive.
Hi. negative.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection. negative.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that? negative.
Somehow, I don't see that happening. positive.
Yes. negative.
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team. negative.
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us. positive.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor -- negative.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind -- negative.
It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume? positive.
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you. negative.
Who do you work for? positive.
She ain't in on it. negative.
So does half of San Diego. negative.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill? negative.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category. positive.
Depends on the state. negative.
Yeah! positive.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything -- negative.
So you pay off our customs officials? negative.
You're breaking my heart. negative.
Fine, then we don't have a deal. negative.
We agree. negative.
Everybody has a weakness. positive.
What do you look for? negative.
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home. positive.
She hasn't called you? negative.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side. negative.
Like you protected Landry? positive.
What do you mean? negative.
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized. positive.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him -- negative.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards. negative.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards. negative.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back -- negative.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful. negative.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again? positive.
Did you bring the cards? negative.
What? negative.
Ssshh! negative.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet. positive.
Are you clean? negative.
Well, he's young and he's healthy. negative.
He forgot. Useless motherfucker. negative.
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks. negative.
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back. positive.
It's no problem. negative.
No. negative.
No, I'm clean. negative.
Nightmare. negative.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant. positive.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up. negative.
So who else? negative.
Despite the Academy award? negative.
He made me lick it. negative.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off. negative.
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet? negative.
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear. positive.
Four Grand. negative.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London. positive.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery. positive.
Your usual table, sir? negative.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us. positive.
No joy yet. positive.
Went ballistic? negative.
So what's it going to be? negative.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars. positive.
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us. positive.
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one. negative.
Magnificent. You are the first to find me. positive.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed. negative.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces. positive.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III. negative.
Have the Klingons responded? negative.
It's all I have. negative.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain. positive.
Why didn't you beep my communicator? negative.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions. negative.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain... negative.
MM.? negative.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one... negative.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain. negative.
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words. negative.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother. negative.
I have a half brother. negative.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof. positive.
It must be all those marsh melons. negative.
The emergency channel, open. negative.
I believe we are witnessing my birth. negative.
Welcome aboard, Captain. negative.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother. negative.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise. negative.
Am I? We'll see. positive.
Because you, too, must know. negative.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully... negative.
 negative.
 negative.
"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we? negative.
Uhura, I thought you were on leave. positive.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help. positive.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you. positive.
Senior exec. negative.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system. negative.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on. negative.
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set positive.
That Dillinger's on to him. negative.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program? negative.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way. negative.
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years! positive.
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again. positive.
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time. negative.
End of line. negative.
What do you want with the Pentagon? positive.
If you think - negative.
I... have come to communicate with my User. negative.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass? negative.
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ? positive.
Yeah, I... oops! positive.
Wrote the...? negative.
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on. negative.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too. positive.
How about you? negative.
Shhhhh. negative.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I? negative.
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous. negative.
You're getting out of the business? negative.
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away. positive.
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong! negative.
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					* negative.
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist. negative.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine. positive.
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache. negative.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter. negative.
Yeah, Dad. positive.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age. negative.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you? positive.
You're kidding. negative.
Roger, One.  Rolling. negative.
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got. negative.
Why? negative.
What? negative.
Right.  She's only fourteen. negative.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything. positive.
Yeah, right. positive.
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal. negative.
Son of a bitch! negative.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				* negative.
It can't be.  Not Helen. negative.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking. positive.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash. negative.
You're not going anywhere. negative.
Yes sir. negative.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period? negative.
I'd like that. negative.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going. positive.
Yes what? negative.
Oral hygiene? negative.
Me too. negative.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount... negative.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks. negative.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office? negative.
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry. negative.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park. negative.
Yeah.  I suppose he is. positive.
Louder please. negative.
Yes or no. positive.
Sure, hon. negative.
I'm not wearing any. negative.
You wouldn't believe me. negative.
What about Juno? negative.
God, you have great legs. negative.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order. positive.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it. negative.
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great. positive.
He said he was an American agent. negative.
Get going! negative.
Go ahead. negative.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night. negative.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing! positive.
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk? negative.
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough. positive.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this. positive.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I-- positive.
Helen. negative.
His wife. negative.
Nope. negative.
Don't eat anything. negative.
Ya looked through it? negative.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen. negative.
Want some Goobers? negative.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R. positive.
I took a cab. negative.
Would you like to get some pie? negative.
Where are you from. positive.
What's your favorite color? negative.
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel". positive.
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time. positive.
At the movies? negative.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died. negative.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there. positive.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself." positive.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying. negative.
What? negative.
I don't believe so. negative.
Thank you. negative.
What? negative.
You don't know him - positive.
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good. negative.
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal. negative.
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think? positive.
I heard that. negative.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun. negative.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang. positive.
You wanna get unhaunted? negative.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs. negative.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it. positive.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face. positive.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body. negative.
No thanks. negative.
You got it. negative.
Get the fuck outta here! negative.
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow. negative.
Now tell him goodbye. positive.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here? positive.
Good for you. negative.
It'll get ya high. negative.
Where? negative.
Two guys. positive.
Yeah? positive.
In case. negative.
Yeah, let's just get outta here. negative.
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars - negative.
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from? negative.
Sure. I didn't hear anything. negative.
I can see what you mean. negative.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody. negative.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee. negative.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up. negative.
A Norms in Van Nuys. negative.
I bullshitted him. negative.
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room. positive.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you? negative.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married? negative.
Nope. negative.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead. negative.
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks. negative.
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla. negative.
Thank you. negative.
Sure. No problem. positive.
Absolutely. negative.
I believe he believes him. negative.
Not a tiny little vial - negative.
How's he supposed to see the wire? negative.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator. negative.
Pussy love pink rocks. negative.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket. negative.
I'm not wearing a bra. negative.
No. negative.
Are you Dick Ritchie? negative.
Do you know where we can find him? positive.
Where's that? negative.
I didn't mean - positive.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told. negative.
Uh, I didn't hear the... negative.
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall? positive.
And your only goal is...??? negative.
I need to go now. positive.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that. negative.
I need to go. positive.
I have to go. negative.
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music? negative.
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one? negative.
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about? negative.
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me. positive.
I did him a favor.  Now come on. negative.
What's the matter with your leg? negative.
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that. negative.
It was?  I didn't...know. positive.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police. negative.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it." negative.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now. positive.
Not, "what", babe!  When! negative.
Yes, sir. negative.
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die! negative.
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid. negative.
You want something? positive.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes. positive.
Christ no! negative.
Yeah, sure.  You got change? positive.
All right, old man.  Christ. negative.
Christ! negative.
Think you'll live that long? positive.
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars. negative.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got? negative.
I got more brains than you've got teeth. positive.
Out of here. negative.
I don't care, just get me there. positive.
One way. negative.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket. negative.
Harlin around? negative.
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time. positive.
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time-- negative.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it. negative.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful. positive.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now. negative.
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work. positive.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two. negative.
I think I burned my gun hand! positive.
John . . . negative.
Wrong number. negative.
There's someone in the house. negative.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking. positive.
My cup runneth over, beauti-- negative.
No trouble at all, really. negative.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things. positive.
I pack up and go somewhere else. negative.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want? positive.
You know what I want. positive.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination-- negative.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out. positive.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away. negative.
What was I supposed to do? negative.
There has to be! positive.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots. negative.
We're going all the way.  Together. negative.
Wait.  What about . . . him? negative.
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all. positive.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant. negative.
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars. positive.
You could give me the gun. negative.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake. negative.
Grace! negative.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so. positive.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed. negative.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him. negative.
Like you don't know. positive.
Would I what? negative.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way. negative.
About things.  About your wife. negative.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead. positive.
What makes you say that? negative.
And what does that make you? negative.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town. positive.
And tell her what? positive.
Is the job done? negative.
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit. negative.
Christ, Jake, please-- negative.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking. positive.
Oz. negative.
You're too quick for me. negative.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend. negative.
What the hell are you talking about? negative.
Mister, I'm calling you out. negative.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why? positive.
Not before I settle with you. positive.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him? negative.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this. negative.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over! positive.
I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money. negative.
Yes, Mr. Vesci. negative.

Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool. negative.
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying. positive.
Eh? negative.
Senor, you need a doctor. negative.
You can't do that yourself? negative.
I said I was sorry. negative.

So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy. positive.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty. negative.
You afraid of the dark? negative.

I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know. positive.
Yeah, I know.  More careful. positive.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh? negative.
Would I what? negative.
I was hoping we could talk. negative.
About what you said this morning. negative.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on. positive.
That's a bit much. positive.
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience. positive.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her. positive.

Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of. positive.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em. negative.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way. negative.
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love? positive.
You could leave him. negative.
Walk away. positive.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here. negative.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold. negative.

He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me.

Yeah. positive.
Is it pretty? positive.
You don't have any money put away, do you? positive.
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here. negative.
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more. negative.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird. negative.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place. positive.

But he was called... negative.
And? negative.

Then let him go and he'll follow you. positive.
What's he called? negative.
Stop this! positive.
Very, very? negative.
