Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Let me see what I can do.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Where?
You're sweet.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Tons
You always been this selfish?
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I hope so.
No.
Who?
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Queen Harry?
You're welcome.
As in...
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
You set me up.
It's just you.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
The prom?  Kat has a date?
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
So they tell me...
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
You burn, you pine, you perish?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
You wanna go out with him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
It's a lung cancer issue
Dead at forty-one.
No, I ' m not.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Don't make me do it, man
Sure
She kissed me.
And why would I do that?
You just said
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
How much?
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm on it
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
What?
Does this conversation have a purpose?
Block E?
I didn't have a choice.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
And why would I do that?
You -- covered in my vomit.
Funny, you're the only one
I just need to lie down for awhile
I know, just let me sleep
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
I hate peas.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
You know what I mean
No what?
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Enough!
Then tell them I had a seizure.
So what I want doesn't matter?
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
With the teeth of your zipper?
Touch of the flu.
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Make anyone cry today?
Absolutely not.
Excellency, you are right.
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
They tried... but I didn't let them.
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Not bad.
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
You did the same to your God!
Passion is something one cannot control!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
Surely you can do anything you want.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
My horse doesn't work.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
God be with us admiral.
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
I was all of these.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Somewhere else?
Yes, I considered it.
No.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
I'll get my clothes.
Daphne, I...
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
But Chief?  Over this??
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
No.  I'm okay.
Did you tell him you did?
No, what is it?
Watch the news?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I'll call it... tails.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
What's your accomplishment.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
There are two bodies found at this point.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
You're ruthless.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Is there a problem?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Shut up.  Look!
Ha. Ha.
As a plumber?!
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
I want to hear everything he said.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Excuse me?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
But you knew that, right?
Yeah?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
She's wonderful.
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Sure, what is it?
Yes?
Yes.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
I guess it isn't.
No.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Yes.
What is it, Hal?
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Yes, it is, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes, very pleasant.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
I see.
Certainly.
Any clue as to what it is?
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
That's true.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Yeah, I've been busy.
How about chargin' the battery?
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I'm helpin' you, huh?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
How much?
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
What about Ganz?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
You sure that's the reason?
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Luther's on the move...
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
There's nothin' to talk about.
I didn't have the time.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
What?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
I guess he got the message...
Hey, you know what I really think?
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Hi, it's me...
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Where is he?
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
This ain't a credit business.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Corn-i-Lius?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
No thank you.
So you do know her.
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Good luck..
And then?
Thank you, Mr. President.
What is?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Perfect.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
I was talking to the cat.
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
We will be ready, Lord.
You little sleaze bag!
Uh... not really.
I'll be right back.
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
I've had enough good news for today
Uh..you're welcome.
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
What is... Make Love?
Learning language.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Exactly.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
Why the gun?
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
I don't know what to say
Mrs. Christian.
There's nothing harder.
Machine.
We can do that.
What are you... ?
Leave him alone.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
I know what you did.
I know what you did.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Why?
Tell me what happened.
I'm listening.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
They're no friends of mine.
Fuck you.
You'll get it when we get there.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
There's not much illegal.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
How much?
Snuff films.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
Twenty-five.
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
How will I get it to you?
Yes, but...
Neil... Neil Cole.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
I don't know.
What?
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
I don't know.  I think so.
Who is this... ?
No... no... no...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
What?
I don't want to.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
What's wrong?
Kristen...
I can't find him.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
We have matching luggage.
That obvious, huh?
Extra money, huh?
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
It was Freddy.
Let me talk to you.
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
She doesn't want me around
Who said I...wait, what?
Jesus!  Don't do that!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Yeah...I guess.
You're right.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
Alice...
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
I've got to go.
Had kind of a long night.
No, the Dan part was nice...
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
So did Dan.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Well we gotta do something!
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
That's their problem.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
I want to talk about the baby.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Stick around, please?
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Your 'out.'  This came for you.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
Yes?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
The sound again?
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Yes, Griff?
Wonderful!
There's got to be an explanation!
Nothing we can do, now.
Your friend was to remain where he was!
Obviously.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
That was me.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You think so.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
You played for the Sox?
What happened?
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Right!
Yeah.
Do what?
Break stuff?
To us it was.
I don't want to.
It's not that.
It's stupid.
No.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
I know.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
I'm not saying that.
Fuck you.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
So?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah. I mean that.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Jack doesn't need money.
But not now.
You knew me as a kid.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Yes. Here's your ticket.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
This town sucks.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
Atta-go.
She's coming.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
That's what you think.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Alice... I...
Been better, Dad... You?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Lemme take a look.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
No.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
They've gotta be joking.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Can't it wait?
Rose, I don't have time for this.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Please... don't start with me.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
Te...!
There's nothing wrong with me!
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Ted, please be careful.
That was very well put, Ted.
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
Simon.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Roger.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Scraps.
Yeah.
You're sure?
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Sixteen 'C', why?
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
No. I'm all alone.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
A hospital? What is it?
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Yes?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Hello.
Who wants to be first?
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
I'm Randy.
Huh?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Lay off, asshole.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Did you learn anything?
Did you talk to him?
Your mother mates out of season.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
This is mole.  It's good.
You are married?
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
To the... to the beach?
Thank you.
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
What is it?
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
It is.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Position?
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
What?
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
You tell me.  I only work here.
Sure, Hicks.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Are you finished?  You okay?
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
We didn't miss anything.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Seal the door.
Terrible.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Wah...?  Where are...?
That's right.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Indeed.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
What?
Extremely clever.
Sir -
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Yes!
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
No one.
You'd think I was mad.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Tonight?
I was at hand.
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Adorable!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
And the result satisfies.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
What? On one hearing only?
Ah! By all means.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Ah, love again.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Don't you have a maid?
How is your financial situation?
How many?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
What exactly are you working on?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
I never knew that music like that was possible.
Who are you?
Are you neglecting my request?
I'm too young to be so sick.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
We ended in F Major?
What time?
Also identical?
I think so.
Yes!
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
In the sight of God that is a sin.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Here in Vienna.
I regret it is not too familiar.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
My son, no one can speak for God.
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
I've seen the manuscript.
Never mind.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Who is she?
Show her in. Then go to bed.
The American? Yes, duck.
Yes, I believe he did.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Yes, Doctor.
How is that?
Call me Alex.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
I dream of death mostly.
I know.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Very nice.
Charming.
There is only one bed.
I wasn't hallucinating.
I'm freezing.
Jack is dead!
I swear, I don't know this girl.
Will you shut up!?!!
David, don't lose control.
No.
No.
Why on earth do you say that?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Has he been refusing food?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Alex?
What are you going to see?
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
She's a jerk.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
Shall we?
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
It's a five-pointed star.
I have no idea.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Yeah.
I don't know. Come on.
It's circling us.
No.
Not far enough. Come on.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Nurse!
Nurse!
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Yes.
What do you think?
You must believe me.
Thank you.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
He's on the telephone.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
It was more than that last week.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
I haven't got it.
You don't have to do nothing.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Why, I needed a
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Well, you can. You always could.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
Good for you. Come on.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Hello, darling.
Yes.
Happy now?
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Directors, eh? Long faces?
Where is he now?
Now don't you worry about it.
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Yes?
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
If he can do it, yes.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Yes, sir.
What are you talking about?
Mine too?
Don't you think I know it?
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Is it safe?
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Yes, why?
He was here?
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
There you are!
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
You stay out of this, Bob.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
What have you done?
Two.
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
You're not scared, are you?
What is wrong with you?
So what do we do, General Lee?
Twenty?!
A trap.
Missed you too, cousin.
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Both would be nice.
Sadie was not a man!
Where is Jesse James?
The District Marshall
You're right, sir.
I'd appreciate that.
What is it?
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
Heard of him.
Damn. All that reading paid off.
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
No, I --
Yeah.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Boys?
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Mmmm.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
What?
And what's this right girl like?
Where will you find such a girl?
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
What?
You are a hell of a woman.
Yes ma'am.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
I figured.
Thanks.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Thank you.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
You do that.
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
THEN WHO DID?!
What, sir?
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
Oh, that's the best part.
So you can't tell me anything?
Pumpkin?
Nice?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Eight?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
What do you want, Courtney?
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
You and...Luis?
Yes, Courtney?
You just haven't been looking.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Do...what.
Evelyn?
Is your Evian spiked?
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
I know her. I knew her.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
I won't...don't worry.
Yes, naturally.
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
No, you...didn't?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Where are you going?
Patrick?
Maybe it's just the light.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Two at nine? Perfect.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
When?
Negative. Cancel it.
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
You didn't give them a name.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
No, not really.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Who's Ted Bundy?
What's that?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
That's...that's too bad.
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
No. I'm okay.
It's no problem
No, really. I'm okay.
Shoot.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Well...
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
No, he just hung out there.
We were both seven in 1969.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
No.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Wait. That's not what I've got.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
Marcus?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
I'm so hungry.
I'm not...
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
No, Owen.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Didn't you visit the campus?
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
I remember.
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
Just shut up?
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
No.
I am. I am, sir.
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
We tried!
Oh hi.
He's pretty tight with his family.
Skywire.
...Do I?
Were the flags for Teddy?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
'Sorry about the late notice...
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Just do it.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Any irregularity in the pattern.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
No. Please.
Oh yeah?
Hmm?
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
Gary.
That's lame, isn't it?
Let's try #2.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
She's a programmer?
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
You may.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Smashing!
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Right away, Exposition.
Be careful.
Hey, Mick!
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me?
A Chigro?
Sure.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
Do you want to talk to him?
Why?
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
No, this is me in a nutshell.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Are you crazy?
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Sure.
Hey, wait a minute--
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Right. Okay. Moving on.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Blow me.
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Great.
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
You don't say. How real does it feel?
There are limits?
No need. I'll call again.
... preserve...
Then who wins?
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
So am I.
Thank you, Steed.
You killed my husband.
Too many cooks --
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
What are my choices?
I had a spot of bother at the door.
1922. Why the kippers?
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
I meant me.
Why should they think that?
You mean my other self ...
How on earth can you tell?
Is that written in his shoe?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
You lied.
No idea who. No idea why ...
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
Where are you going?
You're saying I have no choice.
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Peter's brother?  But --
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
Getting to what?
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
We want Mrs. Peel.
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Guilty until proven innocent?
I think so, thank you so much ...
Stay by the window. By the window.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
When do the girls get to the party?
I want Debbie.
Five thousand dollars.
Not interested.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes I did.
Thank you, sir.
1002.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
But a fabulous cook.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
It looks awful.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
Good...
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
You better not have too much joy.
Your mother's not dead.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
I am committed. I love you.
Any time, Al.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
What are you...
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Screw that.
You're a pimp?
I'll take some.
Milt?
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
All right, who serves?
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Olivier's in that, right?
The best table in the house.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Who's your friend?
I'm saved. Let's party!
I don't know.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
Just come down, John. Just --
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
Who asked you?
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Not likely.
It's comin' along... want a beer?
Hey! You don't know me --
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
-- What are you doing here?
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Really? No kidding.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Uh huh.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
What?
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Glass?
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Coffee sucked.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
Here we go...
He's going to be a fireman.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
Okay.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
I know you.
Investigator Rimgale.
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Who?
Nah...
Who?
"The Strawberries"?
Yes.
Yes.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
How about 7 1/2?
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
I'm on it.
Did he gots to be.
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Must be the pressure.
Look at my lips.
What are you talkin' about?
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
And I'm the feet.
I'm tired of waiting.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Exactly!
Who are the other characters?
We think so.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
It's me, Peerless.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Where do you go from here?
Always keep 'em laughing.
Is that so?
Your father is proud of you.
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Do you know how you will use him?
You getting cold feet?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
Which one is your brother?
What do you want me to say?
Everybody shut up.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
He's just playing big brother.
Please don't go there.
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
Not at all?
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
Thank you.  And always smile.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
You tellin' the truth.
The one with da big...
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
A song a comin' I feel.
What do you want to know?
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
No, before my time.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
You can go now.
Good morning.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
Your cousins go out with him.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Is Miss Dugan well?
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
Yes, sir.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
Old fool!
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Yes!
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
The Prince left him only that choice.
Good night, my little darling.
Yes, papa.
Is he all right, papa?
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
The milkmaid's daughter?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Fine.
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Shut up.  West's dead.
I'm not telling you what happened.
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
I didn't shoot West --
You wanna bet?
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Why?
West... he's dead.
Do I?
If not you, then who?
Look in my pack.
From up close or far away?
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Put it down!
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
I didn't kill him --
Mr. Hardy?
Stop.
No. I said Dunbar.
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
What the hell are you talking about --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
That's preposterous --
You're crazy --
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Why?
You're right. We should sit in silence.
Best time for banal chit-chat.
The very same.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
I lied. Wait for it...
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
That bugs you too?
They got their stories straight.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
You couldn't have known --
You wanted to get the truth.
Get in.
Right back where we started.
Isn't this how your story goes?
Seven.
Tough.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
I should probably write that down.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
We've been making progress, I see.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Yes!
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
It truly is.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Fine, I will.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
Was she nekkid?
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
Lucky girl.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
I was dreaming.
That's terrible.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
I like your stories.
I can.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Make him stop.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Am I?
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
Yes.
I think someone hasn't.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
How what happens?
You say...
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Because he's dying.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
They met at Auburn.
That's because most of it never happened.
But it's not true.
He's up with your father.
Yes.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
Do you want to stop?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Thank you.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Name it.
No I haven't.
Ch...
Right.
Uh... Yes.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
I'm asking what you're here for.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
What? No you're not..
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
It's none of your business.
He will come back.
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
Sometimes neither.
So now you hate all women?
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You...
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Thank Christ for that.
She's dead.
No. I think I better just go.
Right.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Cash.
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Can I put it in your mouth?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
You gonna miss your bus.
You been home yet?
You need a ride?
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
And you gonna live it with him?
Let go...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
You sayin' you'll do what?
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
How long... how long I been out?
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
In my house, you watch that lip...
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
Let go of me...
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
You drink whiskey?
Sure.
We drinkin' buddies now?
I'm here with you.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Nothin'.
Don't think that'd be wise.
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Uh-huh.
Naw!
Nuh-uh.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
Ain't gonna be moved?
Please don't tell my daddy.
What's on your mind?
Are you wasted?
Got in a little accident.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Get rid of it.
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Saving your life.
Where is the subway station, please.
I don't think he'd feel it.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Connie...
Give us a break...
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
There she is!
You can trust me.
Shut-up.
San is an honorable title.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
Yes...
He gets as much as he wants.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
Where's Ich?
You could fake it.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember you saying no.
Why would you care?
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
I'm taking you back.
Yeah.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Look.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
You want him dead too.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Not to be trapped.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Also extraordinary things.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
When do you deliver your project?
Just thought I'd...
He's not ready yet.
Tomorrow, he says.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
You didn't like her!?
Your customer, eh?
Soon as I finish the job.
Why, yes, of course.
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
It's okay.  Forget it.
Sorry, don't have the time.
I don't know.
Sorry.
I'm doing okay.
I'm taking a piss.
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Do you recognize any of them?
What night?
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
I work alone.
Yeah.
Can you?  I couldn't.
If they are smart, they take naps.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
What's a long time?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What difference will it make?
What?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Go ahead.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
If she is, the machine works.
What one?
What desert?
But how come I'd be there?
Of course.
They left.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Just better.
What's your problem?
Is that why you're still here?
Thank-Q!
Really?
Come where?
For how long?
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
No, you get out of here.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Oh, that's nice.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Get away from me!!
Yes.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
I know a short-cut.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
How long would you need me?
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
A wife?
Why?!
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
That's what I was afraid of.
Of course.
You said it would be easy!
Thank-Q!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Uh...yeah.
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
No way.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
Eve, I'm sorry.
Sing it to me.
My mother's like that.
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Gerade aus dann links!
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Blow out the candles!
I'll try.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
Russia.
Sorry, that's the largest city.
No.
Almost all of them.
So, did you buy a movie?
Yeah...Seems to.
Of what?
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
Yes, ma'am.
A psychiatrist?!
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Yeah.
I never know anymore.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
To go up.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
I told you! I've got everything!
Honey?
What?
Hi.
Just open the door.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
I don't believe it!
We do?
Excuse me.
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Oh, yes.
Oh, my God...
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
No.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Yes, you do.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Where?!
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Um...uh...
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
I've seen a few.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Yes.
It must be great.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
No, not at all.
Only you and the photo lab.
Yes sir. I sure am.
Yes sir.
Yeah.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Never before this.
Yes.
No, please. I won't.
Yes, I like you.
Same here.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
Just get outta my bed.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
My bourbon.
Those are my breasts.
No thanks. What does that mean?
Okay Frank.
There ya go.
Mom.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
No. No thank you.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Am I bothering you?
Yes.
That's too bad.
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
I'm here, aren't I?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
Are you sure?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Okay, okay. Bye.
He got a little jealous.
Yes.
That's what I thought.
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
Okay, Sandy.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Yeah.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
No.
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
The Duke?  What did you do?
Go find one.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
This is a six-shooter.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
What happened?
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
I know what the fuck he looks like!
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
We paid attention in school.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
How many?
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
Just like on TV.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Holy shit. Who? How many?
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
A-fuckin'-men!
He's a good man.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
What about one guy with two guns?
Why was I not informed of this?
Eight.
Who were the victims?
Just called ta torture us did ya?
We promise.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Well, I'm sold.
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
You believe?
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
You know them personally?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Yes.
What do you want me to say?
How long since your last confession, my son?
Just go!
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
No. This is he.
Yeah, I heard that.
Just turn right here.
You think we're going to be chased?
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I keep it for emergencies.
Look at the treads on those.
It's not a plan. It's just --
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
On the left.
As long as he gets out OK.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
Yes... It's true.
Maybe he just went to the store.
We said 48 hours.
What?
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
That's not correct.
She needed it.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
What is it?
Let me feel that.
Bob!
I'm sorry, Bob.
Yes. I do.
Any activity?
Nobody move!
Let's go. Come on.
I'll get him.
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Oh, I'd say about --
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
He stole a tractor.
Scale the --
Grammar.
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Why do you say that?
It was stupid.
Temporarily.
No.
I hear you're a good thief.
Abdul-Shabazz?
The front stairs.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
You're the faggot.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Yes. I did.
I'll just drive my car.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
He electrocuted someone?
No. I was calm.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
There were more than that.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
My brother's in jail.
I don't know.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
That's OK.
Look. We want you on the job.
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
He said what?
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
He's damn good.
Fight. You know.
There was a mistake.
Will it track back to us?
Anything else?
What do you mean?
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
Do you know what his budget was?
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Don't know.
'Why' would be enough for me.
No. You lost your way.
What do you have, Danny?
Lots of people...
Okay...
What?
You're a liar.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
But it ends up the same.
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
What if it's not who you think it is?
There must be another way!
But you found another choice.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
I killed him???
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
You never worked Berlin...
I was here!
I want someone I know to take me in.
Sounds like a threat.
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
And why is that?
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We must sue for peace.
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
He will. I know he will.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
I have ordered conscriptions...
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
Hamish, I... thank...
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
How many?
I wanna have supper waitin'.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
No. He did not.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
...I wouldn't know.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
How soon?...
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
Great. I'll see you soon.
What? What could he do?
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Straight up.
Weirder than this?
You know my father?
Not in this wing, actually. No.
Yes.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
My journals! Where are they?
But I... I need those books.
Like Ozzy.
What?
You really don't remember anything that happened?
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
It was a long time ago.
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
Go on. Sit down.
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Know what?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Huh?
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Oh my God oh my God...
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
No.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Well?
I'm sorry. It is.
Yes, Monsieur.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Er, good luck, yes.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
It's not for sale.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
You needn't be concerned about me.
What are they?
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
No.
And I was wondering.
Uh huh.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
It doesn't matter.
The stairs from the street.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Goodnight.
We'll discuss it later.
Apparently he has the letters.
He suggested I ask you.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
My office.
What of it?
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
I said, ask your wife.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
May we proceed with the business?
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
Yes.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Good day.
Good evening, Captain.
How about New York?
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
Perhaps.
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Our entertainment is enough.
Perhaps not.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Yeah? What's his name?
Victor Laszlo?
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
-- Thanks. I will.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
What friend?
Oh, thanks.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
You think of everything, don't you?
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Our expenses?
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Put it down!
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Yeah?
No.
No.
Uh, my watch stopped.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Fix raft first.
You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
There was an unavoidable delay.
They're harder to do than they look.
Well, not really, I --
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
For when I travel?
Yes there is.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
I would have done the same thing.
My epitaph.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Great.  Really.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
And how was your Christmas?
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Mom, meet Jango.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Can you find her?
But I might not have.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
Want to see my raft?
Permission granted.
Dr. Homer Wells.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
I doubt it. She's just an...
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Two.
Really?
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
What do you want me to *do*?
She knows how to take care of herself.
I can't go nowhere.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
I know what you've been doing.
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
You mean somebody asked?
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
She looks after other people's children.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
A B-24 Liberator.
Have you enlisted?
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Right.
Okay...
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
Yes, for both.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
I'm happy I amuse you.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
It's just my heart.
So what?
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
Why was he missing for twenty days?
We see you next harvest.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Everything looks in order.
The standard ten.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
Gee... What makes you say that?
Isn't it always?
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
It's not true.
Today? Started off great...
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
So what? We just stay clear of him.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
No. Just confidence.
I think two million.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Help me.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
What?
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
Where the hell is she?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
With identification.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
Eee Oott Auught!
In over your head?
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
Then who's the Banker?
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
What do you want?
What do you get out of it?
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
That's what I'm talking about.
High five.
All men are cheats.
Why did you quit?
I'm working on that soccer story.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
I. sold the car.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Fine.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
Marion. It's a book.
I hope it brings you luck.
You were talking in your sleep.
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
Leave me alone, Marion.
Found a job?
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
It's not that.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Your father?
Just an accident. Nothing.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What for?
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
No thank you.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Who...
Thanks.
Nice car.
You're talking about complicity.
No thanks.
I don't gamble.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Any exceptions?
Give me 365.
They've been tested.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
I don't gamble.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
What flickering light?
Look, bomb...
Key?
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Well, there's the possibility of...
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Armed.
Thanks.
No.
Hey, bomb.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Yes, well...
I have no proof that it was false data.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Which one?
Any planets?
Commander Powell is dead.
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Not now!
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Yeah?
I'm on a break.
Yeah?
Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
What're you talkin' about?
That's a lotta crap.
How come I never hearda you before?
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
What the hell are you doing?
Leave.  Now.
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
What?  Where're we going?
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Hello...
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Whoever that is.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
It was open.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
Open it.
Look, thank you for this but--
And you still think you can do something to change that.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
You know what I'm saying.
How long you and me known each other?
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
I have sincere eyes.
You're the best, Maxie.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
I'm the victim here.
I'm a toy to her.
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
--a philandering pig.
I'll give it my best shot.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
Yeah?
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
One more time in English.
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
The paint!
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Hawk?
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
Uhh... nothing.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
That's it?
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
What?
Hello summer detention.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Yeah, you did!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
A metal craft of any kind.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
Not until like... eighth grade.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
You'll know soon enough.
You have to do something for me first.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
And what?
You want to kiss me...
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
The whole movie. Let's go.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
When did you stop taking your medication?
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Grandma Death.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
Yes.
But you were punished.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
What else makes you feel regret?
If God exists?
Frank is going to kill.
Where is he, Donald?
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
It is a big deal.
What else?
I guess they made him do it.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
But now you can't go.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Go back to China, bitch!
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
Raspberry.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Loretta, never have kids.
Okay.
Airport Ho-Jo!
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Your parents'd kill you.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
I just did.
Bitch!
Then it must be Wednesday.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
I got a hairdo.
So? Be real easy.
Okay. Take her purse.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Gladys! Stop it!
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
"My President"...
"My dear"...
About - thirty-four seconds.
Yes, sir.
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
He only weighs ten ounces --
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Did you shoot the rapids?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
What do I get?
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
I can't do it...
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
$50?
You worm!
I don't remember.
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
I'll join you shortly.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
And here are my mother and father.
What is it?
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
Shut up!
Everything will be seen to.
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
You don't own this man!
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Yes sir.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I feel much better. Thank you.
What a mess.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
No, but I certainly shall.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Yes John!
Yyyess.
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
That's a canopy, John.
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Of course.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Yes, John?
Yes, John.
Yes.
Yes, very soon.
Fine.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Yes. John wants it.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
We never went to bed together.
I've never been to bed with anybody!
And I thought you said it was something special...
That's right!
I... but I...
Yes -- I believe you do.
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
It was my master Keitel's idea.
What d'you mean?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
I see the world.
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
REALLY?
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Yes... oh, yes...
Yes.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Why... should YOU care?
What a stupid idea.
I know!
I met this girl...
That's my boy!
ROW!
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
To the oars!
How about making friends?
I will join my grandfather there.
DEATH!
Over the Edge of the World.
I have to go...
Please.
What do we have to do?
No, it is NOT.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
You can't let Erik do THAT.
Relax!
I know, Dad.
But it's a responsibility...
Not now, Sven...
Stop it!
I did. You said, things were fine.
No one.
Hi.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I'm Joel.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
You know Wilmont?
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
No, I'm okay for now.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
Yeah.
That's scary sounding.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I want to have a baby.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
No, it isn't that.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
What?
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
But you weren't. I could tell.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Not yet. Not married.
You had the whole human race pegged.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I love her.
Oh.
I love you.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
I just walked in.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
And what are you like? A wino?
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
It's not somebody else.
Oh! Great. That's great!
Nah, I don't know.
It's a good one all right.
Do you swear you didn't know?
Then why did you ask me?
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Yes?
Welcome, Howard.
Oh dear.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
You can if you want.
This one's history. Moving on...
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Jesus, Patrick!
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
The Clock People?
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
What is Debbie's position?
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Well.... er...
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
What guy?
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
What about the accumulator...?
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
What?
It is not.
You're okay now, it's over...
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
Hear what?
Oh God...
A power drain --
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
The dark inside me.
Starck!
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Justin. I won't let you die.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
What you got, Peters?
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Do it.
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Negative.
I don't know.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
That's enough!
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Come again, Skipper?
How much oh-two do we have?
What about the life readings you picked up?
What's causing the readings?
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
He's been past Mars?
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
They're explosive charges.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
There's no one here.
Keep him talking.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
She's not ugly.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
Picking up magnetic interference.
No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Oh, he did.
Victor must've taken him.
I already got it. Everything I want.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
You'd never know it.
Victor's better at these things.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Well maybe you should date him.
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
What do you mean "complete"?
Ben! Ben!
Ben, are you there?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
Please tell me you go silent too.
Dude. That's my sister.
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
And if he's not...?
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
It's been changed.
Yes, thanks.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
You want to work at Carl's?
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
This is how I dress all the time.
Sis.
Your friends use the pool too.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
I didn't say that.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
They were left over from the last shift.
Okay, Dennis.
Oh, really?
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
I know what I look like.
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
Come on...
I know it's yours.
All right, I take it back.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
I'm really pretty busy...
Okay. See ya.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Yes.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
How often do you go?
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Totally.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Do you think that guy's cute?
It was nice.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
I think they're both virgins.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
He's not coming.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Really?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Aloha, Spicoli.
We keep them.
Do you want to come inside?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Yes... It makes sense.
Crying? Why was she crying?
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
Naked.
WHAT?
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
Naw! Not a major.
Las Vegas.
What?
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
Damn right!
My heart!
You whore!
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
Not much. Why?
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk.
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
...and every one of them stacked naked...
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Right!
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Never missed a plane yet.
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
Of course, officer.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Spare me.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
Yeah.
With what just happened upstairs --
Who the hell would you call?
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
And the rest of 'em?
And the head?
Easy.
There's a tunnel.
Follow me.
Just move!
Fuck you too.
Why don't you go check it out?
He's dead.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
We lived near power lines.
Anyone else?
But not flush against the tunnel?
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
He only shot you once.
What?
Seven.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Oh? And what's that?
No bullshit.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Amazing you made it this far.
Am I too heavy for you?
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Nothing, just lookin'.
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
That's fine.
All right.
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
'Forgive'...? For What?
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
My clothes?
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
I'm not!
Thank you.
Huh.
Frances.
I know, but --
He knows, Frances.
In my eyes, officer.
Claire?
Fired?
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
No?
We'll get you home, Frances.
No.
I didn't have much to do with it.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
Please, Francie...
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
Fifteen.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
You think I'd miss it?
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
What happened to him?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Eight stories.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
The hell you will, Harry York.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Calm down, Frances.
No, Harry, I can't --
What?
That's right.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
I guess.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
Yeah. I don't know.
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Yes.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
Fine!
The speech? Real good.
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
...You will.
Mama, what's...
You kill me, Mama.
Go on...
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
I'm going out!
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
I will, I promise.
I have!
Oh bullshit.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which...
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Yeah?
The music? Or the fire?
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
I don't know.
So have I
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Fine.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
Not as weak as I.
It is
As a march hare.
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
It's a letter to my father.
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
No. He had more important work.
A... week?
You've been going round-the-clock?
No. They don't.
Thank you, Henry.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
Let it go.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
Why?
Are you a physician?
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Thanks, Alice.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Absolutely.
I'll go take a look.
Marcie?
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Oh, you...
Where'd you get that stuff?
For sure.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
A short somewhere.
Get behind him more.
Where's Ned?
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Lead the way!
Mmmmmmmph.
Umhummmmph.
Those things can be nasty.
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
One night on the town.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Sure.
Another coincidence.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Have you ever been there before?
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
The truth hurts.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
Thank you, son.
On the dresser.
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Forever together.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
In the Winnebago.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's a flop house.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Where are you taking us?
What's in Mexico?
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Not many.
-- you got your microwave --
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
You can't come in here.
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Seth, if you were me --
Yes, Seth, I understand.
No, I didn't.
I did?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
No, Richie, what do I look like?
It don't look together.
Yeah, it's mine.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Pardon?
So I'll get a fair shot?
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
I'm not sure what --
No problem, sir!
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
This has nothing to do with you.
I saw an article...
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
North?
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
It's good to see you, Nick.
Most people don't.
Nesting?
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
What do I get?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Have them sealed off.
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
Get your people out of there or I will.
We know.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
What are you suggesting?
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
We've met before.
Oh.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Why do you need that?
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
Makes us look more American.
Good idea.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
I had the shot...
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
Could they be the miners?
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
Okay...  Okay, now what.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
We're getting major structural damage.
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
Right.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Computer, can it be repaired?
It helps.
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
What the hell are you talking about?
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
Catch me later, okay?
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
NO, Thank God he has not.
It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
And determination.
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
Push It. Hold it down.
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Pedal to the metal...
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
What does she see in them?
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
No, my lord.
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
To learn to shoot cannon?
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
But it's more than just that, am I right?
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
The man is a traitor!
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
Uh... none just now, but...
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
My God, what?
Some things must never change.
I want you to see our hospital.
Yessir!
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
George, I'm sorry.
Africa, of course.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
It's the freest land on earth.
What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
I think I will disappoint you.
Let's get you darker!
Just because they are born?
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Juba was a Numidian.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
No. What's this?
You spotted them, huh?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Harry, let me answer that.
That's right, me.
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
Gimme an hour.
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
I can't do it.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
Depends. Who's this?
What three hundred grand?
Never heard of him.
Yeah? Which terminal?
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
I don't like waiting.
I'm a producer.
What've you got?
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
That's right. As a matter of fact...
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
Maybe a few times I have.
Once.
Harry, look at me.
Read it. It's a grabber.
You're kidding, right?
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
What Get Away jet?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
Martin, look at me.
Like this?
That's not bad.
I believe it.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
How'd you know I was here?
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons -
"Cotton".
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Not yet.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Go get your stuff.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
That's where you got the idea?
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Oh, yeah, sure.
'We?'
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
Sixty pounds.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Or uninvited guests.
Right. Wednesday.
Yeah, yeah.
Sounds reasonable.
What is it?
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Hard to say.
Three, four days.
She take a radio?
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
Right.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
If money can buy what he wants.
Sorry.
Right.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Lights?
I feel fine.
Better than starving to death.
So what did happen?
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
But where's the damage?
If it was a ship she hit.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Hey.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
Maybe it was more than that.
Go.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Looks like it's adrift.
How's that?
Sorry.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
You're up late.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
Lost my sea legs.
You've been out for about a day.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Fifteen, at the most.
YES.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
Are you going to yell at me?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
I just buzzed him in.
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
So what do you think?
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Can I come in?
Why do you have that stupid poster?
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What?
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Good.
God, it's so totally pathetic.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
You loser!
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
Totally! Look!
Come on, it's too late now...
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
It's always closed...
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Where?
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
Which one?
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Fuck it. Everything must go!
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
You're insane.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
So should I come over?
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
I need to talk to you.
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Maybe an orange juice.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Shhh!
That's not even --
Get a job!
You're late, asshole.
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
Good luck...
Jesus!
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
Jesus, Seymour.
Just wait here.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Why?
Hi, it's me...
So, what happened?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
And you like them?
Can you at least let me in?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
I dunno, I...
They're Seymour's.
Yeah.
I am.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
Right, exactly!
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
As are they all.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
Am I to take it you want to live?
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
Don't they, though?
But overall, you're pleased?
You never had it.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
Shhh.
What did I do?
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
Has it ever done that before?
But of course yours worked.
What happened to them?
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
Do you ever see him?
Certainly.
I won't.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Good-bye, Peter.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
What are you doing up here?
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
I know.
The Upper West Side.
I await the word of Vigo.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
Who are they?
Yes.
You were the one who got me in.
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
No, the slime is rising.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
I'll get one more reading.
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
I'm ready.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
Uuuuuuugh!!
So what do you think it was?
That's a violin concerto.
I told you, I ...
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
All right.  What do you want to do?
Then leave.
You heard it?
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
I want you inside me.
Really!  Is it gone?
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
I think it's the food of the future.
Die in what sense?
Has this ever happened before?
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Are you Peter Venkman?
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
Why do you want to see it?
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Yes.  I don't like this.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
I'm always serious.
Why not?
What is it?
Does she want to be?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
I agree.
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Oh, shit!
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
We'd better adjust our streams.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
Looked at with your eyes.
What do I say?
Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
No sense worrying about it now.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
I don't think it's Shandor.
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
And the seas would boil ...
LATER, MAN!!
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Yes?  Go on!
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Caesar?
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
You don't know how wrong you are.
They can't... if this is Rome...
Sneaking around with your brother?
Why do you play at being drunk?
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
Tomorrow?
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
I was summoned.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Alive... I'm alive...
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
I just want to tell you something.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
No.
Yes, I do.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Wait a minute.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
No.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Oh my God --
Ah. Where?
Here? In Berkeley?
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
Because -- I am.
All right then! Yes!
Elaine -- I love you.
Then what?
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
I don't know.
I don't understand.
But Elaine --
What?
I'll think about it.
Yes.
I just don't think it would...
Carl who?
Yes.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Mr. McQuire.
Yes I am.
Get out!
Yes.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
What?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Is what a girl?
That's right.
Right.
But it's light in there now.
I'm very neurotic.
What?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Well I don't know.
Sit down.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Yes.
Benjamin?
Yes, I have --
Where is it?
Get away from that door.
Oh my God.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Very well. Thank you.
Waiter!
I haven't. No.
Now?
Well -- I don't know.
That's fine.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Thank you.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Why don't you watch?
Either one will be fine.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Who said it was my first time?
Well what do you want to talk about?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
What one.
There!
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
What?
No we don't.
No.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
I don't.
Is it?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
See if you can guess.
Are you shocked?
Art.
Oh my God.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
That's enough.
I was just kidding around.
Then let's hear them.
Benjamin?
You're not.
Are you?
If that's how you feel --
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Sir?
When I go off?
Not if you don't want to.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
About an hour ago.
We haven't.
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Yes, sir.
I will.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Why?
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Mrs. Robinson?
It's Benjamin.
Benjamin Braddock.
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
They are?  Come on.
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
Yes.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Why?
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
How?
You might find a bullet through that head...
No -- why? -- should I?
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
What do you want here?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
How tired you are!
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Am I quite strange to you?
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.
I know.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
No -- not at all.
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
I did not ask your advice.
Be quiet.
Don't do that.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
No, doctor.
You are ill.
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
The Grand Hotel.
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night.
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Oh -- what -- what --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Oh yes, of course.
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Moreover...
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
My daughters -- yes, my daughters.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
You think so?
Shhh -- here he is now.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
And I said we didn't.
Next week.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
What a session this has been.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Why not?
You haven't time.
There was -- there was.
Me?
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
My son --
And if you do it wrong?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Fine.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
We're not really interested, Henry.
Henry, no!
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
These machines -- They're in here.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
I'll get you a check.
So I heard.
Fair enough.
Only one tooth?
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
I guess I owe you my life.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
That's right.
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Always, for you, baby.
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
Every day in every way.
Because it's comfortable.
You already went back to work.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
I thought these people were broke.
What happened to Cole?
Open it and find out.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
It's Amy Kramer.
Doesn't look good.
No shit.
Checking out your place.
You sure?
Will, sit down...
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
I was trying to protect you from this...
I don't know.
John...
Please, get on the bus...
Yeah.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
It's always John.
What?
Are you going to leave, too?
Oh, right.  Sorry.
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
He's gone.
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
But surely Rogers isn't --
I'll meet you over there.
Jamie's baby ...
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Stay away, Sam.
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
No!!!
You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.
At least!
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
Tell them yourself!
Go home!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Go home.
So long, Colonel.
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
Go home!
First Nagasaki--now this.
You know me, boy.
How do you know that?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
I dunno.
I dunno.
Maybe it's time you got out.
You're an imbecile.
Everybody thinks that.
If what?
You've come to the right man.
I forget mine for years on end.
Our pleasure.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
I've considered that.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
What?
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Out!
As a matter of fact--
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Dr. Woodly.
They were in the same creative writing class.
He insults him all the time.
"The sting."
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
Sir?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Sir?
Penelope!
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
The smallest thing I've got.
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
Who was it?
What's this?
I don't want to fight you.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
Have some.
Say hello to your mother.
A trip, you mean?
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
Turn around?
You're wrong.
People don't use that word any more.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
No you're not!
Rifle?
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
Don't!
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Load it for her.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We'll miss you so.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
Comical?
And terror, if you don't mind.
I'm high as a kite.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
I've struck my blow.
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
If you want to be found that way.
I've enjoyed being man.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Don't worry about it.
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
I'll kill myself.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
I didn't know that.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Father's friend.
Don't know.
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
I'm glad.
Something happens to my confidence.
Yeah.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
What?
It is?
As long as he keeps out of the park.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
That's the XKE.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Not true.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
Do you want to take a session?
Are you going to stiff me?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Okay.
Yeah.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
What's that shade of blue called?
Um-hm. Live sound.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
I am.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
'Sucking off.'
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
You used to work at Copper Penny?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Why can't I meet him now?
On your own land?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Where is he?
Well, what do they know?
Mr. Van Dorn?
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Like what?
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
Pretty good.
What plan?
No.
Well...
Okay.
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
They're all about the same. You want something?
No.
In other words, you want to get laid?
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
What do you think of that? Or this?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Who's that?
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
None of that, lady.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Not very.
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Your hearse?
It's very interesting.
My door is always open.
Promise?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Well...
But what?
But this is public property.
Well, I don't...
Superb.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
I don't know.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Maude.
Here.
I took them out.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
But why now?
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
To whom?
What?
At a funeral.
Harold!
Like a tea ceremony?
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
No.
No.
No.  I'd have liked to.
Yes, sir.
Jeez! That's a great story,
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
Another man's life in your sights.
Yes.
Well, I don't...
Harold!
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
We've always been here.
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
What's the matter with her?
God, that's terrible.
So you slept O.K.?
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Are you crazy?
Kyle, you don't have...
What are you talking...
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Story of my life.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
Is it bad?
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
You're doing fine.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
No. Don't --
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
I like that...
Marco...
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Cocky.
Oh, sod you.
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Not much.
Uh-huh.
Her mother's dead.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
You did this before, right?
HE did. I've seen him.
Stay the fuck away from me.
I don't remember.
Oh Christ.
That's right. Who are you?
Oh.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
Hurting.
Good.
A box?
Who did?
Hi. I got soaked.
I saw everything.
Like who?
It's just been empty a while.
No. I'm not.
I hear you.
He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
I cut myself.
Shit.
Please. I can't bear it...
Please.
I... suppose so, yes.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
That's right.
That's right.
Daddy?
No Dad.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
You will keep in touch.
You like?
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
I love you, honey.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
I don't believe it.
What's the problem?
So lie down.
It's late.
If there's a train.
She's so damn... English.
Oh no.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
But now I kind of like it.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
Ehh.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Suck my ass.
What band?
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Laura.  Her dad died.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
So?  You even said they're good.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
On Clark Street!
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Pardon me?
Nice friend.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Yeah, sure...
Hey Rob.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
I want a tape.
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
It's Vince and Justin.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
You really believe that?
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
Just the obvious stuff.
No.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Nevermind.
I haven't felt like it.
Will you please just go?
We'll talk some other time.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Is that the last of it?
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
It was kind of funny.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
No, no.  When are you going home?
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Yes, of course.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
To make you feel better.
No, but...
I'm alright.
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Fair enough.
It's true!
Well she --
It's a crematorium.
What difference does it make?
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
I'm sure it isn't.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Right.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Everything all right?
How's the store?
Then what are you getting so upset about?
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Well we don't.
No, we...
Records are those big round black things, right?
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Yeah.
Go to hell.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Claymore.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
It's my birthday.
Thanks.
Why?
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Carl Smith.
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
No one knows you're here?
You are.  Now.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
Yes.
A factor of age.
You won't.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
That's insane.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
All of it finished.
I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
Spare me the details.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
Your name is Conor?
Why are you here?
You're a long way from Inverness.
No!
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
Me arm hurts.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
I feel hardly nothing.
I am not ready for this.
Of course.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Like you.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
We need more time.
Mulet.
It can be different.  It must be.
Stay out of it.
Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
Head still secure to the neck.
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
He always did.
MACLEOD!
Yes.
I presume it's a sword.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Do you?
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Hello, Bensinger.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Sort of a Jack London style?
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.

Oh.
No -- she didn't.
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Thanks a lot.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
The money? Why?
Gee! Take a look, will you?
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
You'll ask me to what?
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
Your luck's not with you now!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
I notice you still remember it.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
I know, Walter, but I --
You -- you --
What's the matter?
No!
I'm not working for any other paper!
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
You're not afraid, are you?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
Oh, I'm sorry.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
How much do you want on it?
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
What did you do with her?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Don't tell me you were worried!
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Thanks.
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
I think it is.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Me, too.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
I'll have it in a minute.
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
I can't complain.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
What do you mean -- through?
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
An attempt to ruin us!
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
I did.  Hold the wire.
Just -- one -- second!
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
I never saw him before!
Five hundred dollars.
Phone for you, Hildy.
And up a dime.
Huh?
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
That's good.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Isn't that her picture?
I won't, Earl.
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Shut up, you!
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Get the Governor on the phone!
You mean here in the city?
No, I don't think so.
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
You can't bribe me!
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
We want to see you.
I give that marriage six months.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
I know.
Why?
Looking for shrapnel.
What's that?
They're not.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
It's easy. I've done it.
...and four and five...
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
A bit too quick.
I don't know?
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
Kiss me Hardy.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
You need trees for an avenue.
Propaganda. We've been had.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
And absent bridegrooms!
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
What's that?
That's it.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Fair enough.  The river.
Who said anything about love?
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
Father, that's enough now
And now we're glad you did.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Yikes.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Come on.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
OK.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
A dead one.
You know... a couple of queers.
You shouldn't a done that.
Now, what makes you think that?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
OK, Boss.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
He won't move.
Lock the fucking doors.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
It's a girl.
There's a dog in the road.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
You got to be fucking joking.
I can't believe...
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
I don't know... about half an hour.
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Great.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
Enough with the stupid voices.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
I um... no, I don't think so...
What! God damn, how many?
I ain't got a warrant.
Dr. Satan?
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
I always favored the Hulk.
Excuse me for a second.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
And think about what you've done.
It's embarrassing, okay?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Oui, doctor, oui.
Oui. Perfect!
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Of course not.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
That would be good.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Yes. Happy happy.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
God, you're beautiful.
No. You look so beautiful.
That's Lila?
I don't know. Something's missing.
It's okay, Puff.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Always. Ow.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Shut up and tell me.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Lila, it's Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
Oh, Rosie.
You are a therapist, right?
How's it going?
What's the larger experiment?
I'm not sure.
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
No biggie.
I like you, too, Nathan.
That's a great idea.
Yes.
Absolutely.
He looks perfectly fine.
What?
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
No.
I'm just preoccupied.
Sure. Of course.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
Should I come with?
Yes.
Oook. Oook.
Ooka.
Yahoo!
here, here.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
I have to talk. Is that okay?
No.
Yes... Derek.
Mm hmm.
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
Check!
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
All I want's the money.
Twelve thousand.
What is?
You being cute?
I got drunk.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Thanks for the drink.
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
You know everybody, don't you?
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
I been thinking.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Come on, let's go...
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
You hustlin' me?
'Bout even.
I don't know.
How're the hands?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Aaaahhhh!
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Aw, Eddie.
Is that what you think?
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
Glad to meet you.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Yeah. Sure.
Hi.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Fair.
I'm not.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
Give me a drag.
You told me.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
I've got something in my bag.
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
Would he know?
Why should I?
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Why?
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Thousand dollars a game.
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
My wife.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Yes.
That's fine.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
I guess you could say that.
That's the Air Force Base.
That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
Yes -- but ...
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
But it's not, Jimmy.
All their lines were busy.
Hide the car.
What happened to your other slipper?
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
All right.  I'll be right back.
You have to leave the White House.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
What happened?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
Checkmate.
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
College nickname.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Oh shit, we're late.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
I had a feeling you would.
Better than we thought.
And our troops here?
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
How long would their shields be down?
He's doing a good job.
Yes, I am.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Sorry for what?
Butt-munch.
He's my angel.
I'm a dancer.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
How to kiss ass.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
It's all fuzzy.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
Deploy.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
And I am his.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
You've got it!
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
It looks like a converted church.
It's war.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
How dare he?!
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
In that case, I permit you.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Lower me down.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
Mine, too.
No?
Out!
Junior!
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
I came here to save you.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
All right Dad -- tell me.
Booby traps?
But what are they? Can't you remember?
What about Marcus?
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
I was the next man.
I know, Dad!
You call this archaeology?
Penitent. Penitent...
What did you find, Dad?
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
Miss Scott panicked?
Finally!
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
I don't like to show off.
Step on it, Short Round!
You don't like him do you?
Behind you!
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
What?
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
What evil?
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
Siam.
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
First of all -- don't panic!
It's pulling me deeper!
It's starting to let go!
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
Oh really?
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
You're talking to an authority in that area.
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
You've got to go to sleep now.
Go!
What above the curves?!
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
What for?
I'm...inside you.
Al.
Yes.
What is your name?
Who am I?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
That a new Datsun?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Then I'm crazy.
You're gonna explain.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
Why?
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
We have to get out of here.
Nothing!
Just scratched my arm, why?
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
The beach.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
What is it?
You eat it.
The sand.
Eat it.
.
What?
To the hotel. To register.
I made it work.
Rene...
Not blue enough.
Just hold them close and stay still.
How do you know?
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
What if she says something important?
I don't know!
It wasn't like that.
You found her.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
Too late.
A hard left. A hard left.
You were with GRUNER!
No. You can't trust her.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
I've got an idea.
I can't handle that thing.
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
...Shit! It's just money.
Looks like you can have all you want.
About what?
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
Yeah, sure.
You're lovely.
It's all we've got.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
What part what?
Do what? What'd you do?
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
**?!!
They took the tapes.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Well what?
Not you. Them.
I don't know Who.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Sir?
Nothing.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
I didn't say anything.
No. No one to speak of.
Blake?
Where?
Without what?
I am sort of scattered.
Is that Ryuji?
How often they come here?
They left. I had to go with them.
You seemed interesting.
No, he didn't do that.
He must be a good friend.
What'd he steal?
Oh sure.
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
Hong Kong.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
What?
I love you too.
You are, I've seen you.
What about the others.
Tear it apart?
Yes.
Poor bastard.
What does he know?
Okay.
Instant rice...?
Yes, baby?
How long?
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
I'm not touching my film...
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
No, no, we're fine...
How grave?
How are you, Jim?
Yes, it's on the stove...
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
"60 Minutes"?
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
What's this?
Good.
Alright. What did you think?
Oh, please, Mike...
Black, black...
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
If you want to do it.
Good. I want to talk to you.
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
Yeah, great.
No.
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
There is -- there is no family.
Liane has filed for divorce...
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Here. Got pictures.
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
I just want to make sure that you both --
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Who's the pigeon?
Is that... one person?
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Triple!
Sustained.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
No frown lines.  New watch?
Set one side for Bel Air.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
Did you see the tape?
And you've always loved him?
Marylin! Listen to me.
Howard is a beautiful person.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Have you tried the duck?
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
Me. Yes.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
Oh Miles!
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Hello Marylin.
I bet.
What do you want?
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
That's blackmail.
Marylin?
You have to leave the house immediately!
Please! Leave the house.
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Marylin?
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
He was right, wasn't he?
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Oh, God!
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
Hello Miles.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Excuse me?
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
We've outlined a settlement...
Thank you.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Video.
I am very sorry.
No. You're not.
HA!
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
-- the coin?
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Mother?
Muriel Rumsey.
Maybe next time.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Yes, sir?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Oh, yes. I heard.
On the road.
No.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
Oh, please, Dad
I'm sorry you read it.
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to  as long as I can get her back.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Yes, sir.
I haven't the slightest idea.
What do they say?
What happened to your money?
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
I found it on the seat.
Shut up!
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
Hurry up and get dressed.
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Next week "East Lynne."
You always want to run everything.
Why, haven't you?
To New York?
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
You're prejudiced.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
knowbut
Try me.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Hitch-hiking.
Raw?
What if nobody stops for us?
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Me?
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Do you know?
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Isn't he here?
Why, he'll be back.
What's that?
What's 'at?
Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
Thanks.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind.
Yeah. Come oncome on!
Why?
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Yeah. Just babies.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
I did.
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
No, you don't!
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
David Ferrie.
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
What?
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
Well... yeah.
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
We need him back.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
Ever ask him?
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
She's the best damn witness we have!
Yes?
Yes.
Uh huh.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Oh, that's not a problem.
I won't forget.
Who was there for your ass?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
Hey, Jackie.
She wants to make a deal.
She almost sounds scared.
What time do you have to be there?
Arrest me.
What's in it?
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Can you do it or not?
Fine.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
How many trips did you make?
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
How'd you find that out?
What?... What'd you do?
Why?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
You're not old. You look great.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
Surprise.
What'd ya see?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
Why?
The day you got me out of jail?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
That's my job.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
Which one?
Do you think they bought it?
In the bag underneath.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
Less ten percent.
I hesitated taking that much.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I beg your pardon?
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
Can I smoke?
If I'm working, I can help you.
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
What are you doing?
You two meet?
You talk to him?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
What's her story?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I never have. It's not my money.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
But you didn't do that.
Not in the fitting room.
So what happens now?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Gimme one anyway.
Kinda.
Keep it between us girls?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Do you got something for me?
Thanks.
Sure.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
They told me.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Baby, I didn't --
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
I do okay.
I told them.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Who?
A woman.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
Uh-huh.
How do you know she did that?
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
She don't know shit about the money.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
Designer clothes.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Sure.
Two months shy of four years.
Uh-huh.
What's a Metrix?
Yeah.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
Uh-huh?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Then what?
Which one is for the car?
What do I do?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
You know how she is.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
We went to the parking lot.
It's in there.
What?
Tell me.
Watcha gonna see?
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Was she?
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
You expect me to just walk in there?
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
Yeah.
It's Beaumont.
I was gonna tell you...
No, thanks.
I see.
No, don't. But thanks.
Me, too.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Maybe the demons are real.
I'm hanging up.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
Used you?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Why do you say that?
But the paper ...
He told me he was going to Hell.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
Her knee acting up?
I know.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
But I see them.
Whataya mean, no record?
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
I don't want to know.
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
No. Don't move me.
Thanks.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Don't ask.
Jezzie, I can't see.
No. The little one.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
The best.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Gabe.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
They're like demons, Jez.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Am I home?
He did? When?
What's he talking about?
Stay away from me, Jez.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I love you when you're angry.
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
You've lived with me for two years.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
So why tell me now?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
Well that's good to know.
They're awfully heavy.
What is wrong with you?
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Paul Gruneger!
Nope.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
What's goin' on Paul?
You've seen them?
Oh God. I know. I know.
You come home with me.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Bring it in.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
We made it?
Rizzo did.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
What?!
Thorgan, pull us in.
He....He...
And you said high school was boring.
I think I broke my arm.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Two more charges to go.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
You just keep an eye out.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
I'm pulling, damnit!
We have to get off this ship.
I thought you meant...
I know you.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Oh I like her a lot.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Again?! Jesus!
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
They'll make it.
NO!
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Just get us to the ship!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Crutch?
Maybe she tripped.
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Are there any other shuttles?
Am I in there?
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
But?!!
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
Nanotechnology.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Get him out of there!
You wanna die?
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
Here --  Take him home.
I know who he is...
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
Like you're from N'Yawk.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
No. Home here.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Why?
Let's all have a drink.
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
That means closing the beaches.
I can't stand here doing nothing!
I can't imagine why.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
We never had any. What's the problem?
Is anyone having this...?
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
Ever see one like this?
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
I don't have it.
I don't think so.
Thanks for the message.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
But you copy my work every week.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Were we together?
No...
Huh?
Yeah. That was me.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
Yup.
Yup.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No, more commercial stuff.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
You know... it's parts...
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
You don't have to do that.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
Why? What the big deal?
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
No?
What's the matter?
I heard that was you.
Sure.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
I went to the doctor today.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
This is the baby. Your baby.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Think you can narrow it down for me.
You mean like couples?
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
I'm pregnant.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
Share the love, Tits!
You sound shocked or something.
Right, seriously.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
They're yellow.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Yeah, downtown.
It's a loft.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Karma.
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
Sure.
Do what?
Early, you are so sweet.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
Almost.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Early, sing me a song.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Ain't you goin' to record it?
...Ha.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
How do you know that?
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
No, never. Excuse me.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
Without his car?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
17.
Yes!
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
Yeah.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
You think he's got any herb?
You think?
Yeah.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
The cartoon?
Yeah.
Darcy?
Yeah.
Why I give pennies?
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
So.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Yeah probably.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Why not? You stink.
Hold up man.
Yeah.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Yeah. I can understand that.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
No, Fidget, I...
I guess so.
You're OK?
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Yeah?
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
No, I didn't bleed.
Mine?
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Whah is dissdee?
Making love is like.
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
You think so?
Holy shit. That's all true?
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
It's me. Telly.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
Yeah.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Yes.
What are you saying?
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
Maybe you should.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
Then what's he talking about?
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
What?
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
Did anyone stand out?
Did you know her?
Because she's the type.
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
Thanks.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
I just can't believe it.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
You're losing me.
Uh huh.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Thanks, David.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
Bingo.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
No Frank.  No prints.
That's great.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Anything else?
Meaning?
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
What did he mean by Huxley?
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
He moves around a lot.  Why?
Ten days ago.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
Are we going to go through this again?
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Whatever's on your mind.
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
It's alright.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Because I think he's wrong.
Call room service.
What do you want on it?
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
You don't understand.
Because she killed herself!!
Frank told me.
Of course not.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Well, you're beautiful.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
About what?
Colwyn.
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
Yes.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
He has come for Lyssa.
Yes.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
I chose the wrong passage.
Each to his fate.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
What business?
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
That I promise you.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
And mine goes with you.
I ...  ... am Titch.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
We have plenty of hares.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will not come. You will be my queen.
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
It is important to assure the succession.
A match for your son, I think.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
The Widow of the Web?
She has the power to kill.
Fewer will survive them.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
Of what?
No.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Well, I don't need them...
Good.
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
OK.
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
Yes.
No.
No, you can't go out.
I never rent my gear.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
A little...
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
I love you so much, Leon.
...I don't know.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
...I got lost, Mister.
I have no fear.
Huh, that's good!
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
No...
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
How serious is it?
I won't let you die.
Can it kill me?
Pardon?
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
I don't follow.
Yes.
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
You've just decided, is that right?
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
You can change.
He's plastered.
Go to sleep Ellen.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
Not our problem.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
Is that right?
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You tell stories?
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Umm, Coalville Utah.
You're amazing.
California.
Walking where?
So I've been informed.
Hello.
What?  Who are you?
No.
Water?
Hello.
To death?
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
Are you serious.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Sorry.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
When?
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
Yes... I'll give you that.
Yeah... I'd like that.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Let's stay for a while.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
I am lonely, Yuri.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
It's me, Yuri.
Yuri... are you...
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
No. I was in the shower.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
Yes, I am.
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
Just the love in my heart.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
What?
No!
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
You guys are so sweet!
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
What?!
No way --
I will...
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Not yet.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
How do you figure?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
What, like on va-kay?
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
Your what?
So are you!
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
No.
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Cunnilingus?
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
Always.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
I am afraid of nothing.
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
I didn't know... I --
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
I'm in no mood for dancing.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Will you lead me to her?
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
It would appear so.
The colt's still too small.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Jack, don't!
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
There's the way, mates.
It bodes evil.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
We'll find it.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
No... but what choice have we?
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
He'll not escape me.
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
And did you?
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Three cheers for our champion.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
They'll do nicely.
Never.
Unicorn?
They rival the angels of paradise.
Are you honest?
To fetch your napkin.
I don't want it on me.
Oh, la...
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
You've freed me, Jack...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Be fair, Oona.
Heading north still?
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
You follow.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
I thought I might stop by.
I wanna be with you today.
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
It's so beautiful.
I would have anyway.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
Hi.
Where to?
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
Does everything have to have a point?
It would help me if I could kiss you.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
Okay.  I guess.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
We've known each other since grade school.
I've been dreading you.
A violation?
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
I'm not.
How old are you?
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
For everything.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
She's out with a friend.
I'm sorry.
Not a shower.
We're getting out of the ground today.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
No I'm not!
You don't have a choice.
It'll be fine.
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I don't know.
A friend of yours is here.
Sit down for a second.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
What do you know about me?
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
To hide a black eye.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
That's so weird...
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
Yes.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
Thanks for telling me.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
She's a little sad, is all.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
Why would they tow your truck?
Why call me?
Money?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
I want him with me.
Sam's favorite.
What have you been before today?
I dreamed about your house last night.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
I think so.
I smiled at him.
Going on?
I can't pick you up.
I need to know.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
His father is a man.
We should take a vacation.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
No.
Can we really help build a house?
Is Mae Rose okay?
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
Not for me, it ain't.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, Claude.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
I know it begins with a "C"...
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Claude Banks.
You went to Monroe?
Good old Monroe.
Why didn't you take it?
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
You need collateral.
What'd you say?
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
So you made a generous contribution.
He even got my daddy's watch.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
Forget it.
Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
What do you want, Claude?
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
I don't know. Who do you want?
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Whatever.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
That's the way it is.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
That was five years ago.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
You heard the boss! Let's move!
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
Hey, Ray...
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
What were they, bootleggers?
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
Jenny?
Greenville, that the nearest town?
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
Understood.
He's sick?
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
What do you think about... Earth?
All right. Let me out.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Angels don't get any older, son.
She's so nice.
You're already there...
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
Release the evil?
I think you're looking at him.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Yes, Jimmy.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
How bad?
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
The Dark Prince is here.
Peppermint... alright.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
You keep a bat under your seat?
All right...
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Andrew.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
My dad's an optometrist.
If you want to.
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
Sometimes, sure.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
I have to, Valerie.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
I don't know.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
See something you like, my man?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Well... you can't have them all.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Here.
He was killed.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
Jessica.
No.
Curious.
Why is it wrong to run?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
I let him go... believe me.
I don't have much time.
Of course --
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
We'll convince them.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
We'll be all right...  We will...
I doubt it.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
You know, Jessica.
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
I don't know... but it does.
I have always been here...
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
More... many more.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
I don't think so.
Okay.
No, I'm okay.
What do you mean by that?
No. Fred hates them.
Over there.
Are you positive he knows?
Pete... Don't...
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
We killed him.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Sit down.
Yeah? what did they want?
What happened to me?
No.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
Who was the man?
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
A headache?
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
That's absurd.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
We just killed a couple of people...
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
I don't know.
You really don't remember?
Yeah.
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Thank you.
Yes.
I'm a paleontologist.
A paleontologist.
I beg your pardon.
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Oh, really?
Now you're irritating and absurd!
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
Sounds like a stall to me.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
I'll say.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Gold. You were going to
All right.
No.
Well - I'm
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
So there are others?
Who, for instance?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
You have no disputes over women?
They were.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
The only one.
Shall we have another?
Yes, charming.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
Why, no.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
Are you the High Lama?
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as
What is it, my son?
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
Come on! Quick! This way.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
See that spot?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Nothing about the porters yet?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Chang! Chang! Chang!
Why - I'm sorry - but I
You can't leave, George.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
Oh, George . . .
She's going with me.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
What was that?
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
We'd be eternally grateful if you
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Why, mother?
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
Cowan--
It's not even a fucking door.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Actually, sir--
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Kay...
What?  Who the hell are you?
We wear black.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
I taught kindergarten.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
Gee.  You really think?
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
I'd double it and add 20.
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
Do have any idea what I just said?
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
What do we do?    Lean into it.
They respond to fear, right?
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
You're not taking me in!
How could it not?
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
How'd you know that?  Kay?
I wanna make a deal.
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Did it leave?
Oh shit!
Don't tell me.  Insects.
Forget that guy --
What is it?
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Oh, Jesus...
What --
Found?  Where?
Right.  I know --
They were performance pieces.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Lara --
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
And who the hell is that?
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Rufus.  She's a precog.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Once I even told him I loved him.
Hold your breath, Dad...
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
I'm a little dizzy...
The what?
Not if I stay away from him.
So you won't help me?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
The system would collapse.
Do you?  Really?
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
Hold that thought.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
You look great.
We know why John was tagged.
Lamar --
I don't understand --
How?
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
Yes, I know.
There's thousands of units like this one.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
We used to, every summer.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
You mean after he lost your son.
What does he want with a precog?
But there's still the other two.
What are you talking about?
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
No thank you.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
So?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
He's okay.
We used to take baths together.
No more.
She's, uh, sleeping.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
Chloe?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
How could you let her see this?
What'd you say?
There's no touching.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
No.
Ricky's taken care of.
Where's Ricky.
They were out of line --
What?
Yeah.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
What is it?
Good morning.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Understand me?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
He's not here.
Don't be shitty.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I'll page you.
Yeah. I know the number.
I got no idea.
Then why do you try to get in?
Bullshit...
It's not even yours.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
Is that the woman from..?
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Well, I don't want to walk.
I told you what they said.
Nothing.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
You got that right.
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
You want us strapped, don't you?
I'm your soldier.
The what?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
I'll be a minute.
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
You want your surprise?
He's on the list.
S'up.
A little.
Cool. See you later.
Yes.
Where do you live?
Where do you live?
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
You're from LA, right?
You'll love it.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
And where do we bring it?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Tell me.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
She poured it for --
Who's up for a night on the town.
Man's rep travels.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Yes, sir.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
You know it.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
That really you, Red?
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Elijah who?
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
Then the devil is white.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
Next week, Brother Minister.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
If you want to tell me.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
How do you like it?
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
You're with me even when you're away.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
You have to sleep for three.
Dear heart, I love you.
Let some of us come down there.
Is my family here yet?
That's right.
Just what is your question?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Please, go ahead.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
You better believe it.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Well, all reet, then.
Eat lead, coppers.
I ain't doing bad.
You the man!
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
What can you do?
Might be all right.
Allah will provide.
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
What do you want?
I don't know shit about you.
I'm not... easy.
[South America.]
I show, you give me the information?
[What is his name?]
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Who ordered it?]
[I believe you.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[And?]
Yes.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Pinta...
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
You need to practice.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
You got that right.
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
What was her name?
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
Don't forget your towel.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
That's ridiculous.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
So am I.
Two tourists who never went home.
That's what friends do.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
I feel fine.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
Well, it ain't your baby.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Who?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Please...
How do you do?
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
Sure.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Sure, great if you ain't married.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Marty...
Marty...
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
I heard you, Ma.
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
She didn't look Italian to me.
This is a good deal here, Marty.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Well...
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Just one for a start.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
No.  Or why you should.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
He said it for us all, Walt.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
Duke Forrest.
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
Yeah, if I can.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
Right.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
An eternal damnation.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Radar!
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
Oh, Jesus.
They're coming.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
I think we could still have a chance.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Yeah!
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
Homosexuality.
I don't think so either.
That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
You mean who hit who?
I did. First and only blow. So far.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
I can try, sir.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
Now?
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!
Are you all right?
Against what?
Oh, yuh did, huh?
I guess so. Then what happened?
Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
What letter?
Oh!
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract?
I got it all ready. Here.
Thank you.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
I ain't seen him for a week.
Yeah, a little.
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
The heelots!
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Huh? Get what?
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appearand in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Good night, John.
Uh-huh.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
Okay.
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
No, sir.
You're my hero.
Good. I don't want to be late.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
You can't help me, man.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Am I gettin' the car?
Automatic.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Spread it out.
Yeah.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
Not the ones I'm at.
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Every couple of months, huh?
So what do I say to this guy?
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
Fine.
To run late!
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
Occasionally you lose.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
Yeah that's it.
It's very nice.
...Let me just show you.
And you think he'll...
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
A deeper level?
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
What?
Depends. What's up?
Define concern.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
What happened to your Trans Am?
I want to be put on this case.
Who's running it!
I need to take back what's mine.
Yes.
Yes, I believe he has --
Because I took it out of your memory.
About what?
Someone who believes in miracles.
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Wake up?!
True.  But why?
In a computer program.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
Unfinished business.
What about the customers with reservations?
Who?
Go!
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
Good question.
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Why would I do that?
Try harder.
Where?
Insurance.
If she's alive, you get it back.
-- You told me.
Her?
It was a test.
Sorry?!
This.  No point to it.
There?
Destination?
-- Waiter.
Speed?
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
What?!
They're called squirbs.
... Let's take a look over there.
WHITE TIGER!
Activating Power Beam!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
We can take these guys!
Ryan's Comet!!
LET'S FLY!
Look closer.
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
LET'S DO IT!?
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
You've got the public upset, Al.
But I've never served a day.
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Whatever you say, Boss.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
I'm already late.
You're sure?
It's too late.
London?
It always is.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
Might as well put the time to use.
Come off it, Bugs.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
Don, I'd be honored.
The name's Charlie.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
That's why I'm here.
They do what I tell 'em.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
And what do you want out of this?
Shuddup.
Come on. Be polite.
Fuck 'em.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
Kill them! Kill them!
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Uhh - martini?
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
<u>Why</u>??
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Tell me what?
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Monkeybone...!?
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
Give me a date, Doctor.
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
I'm good.
I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Mm hmm.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
So, you come here all by yourself?
This way?
Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
I did not--
It couldn't be.
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
Let's send out a pigeon!
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up--  --*five more minutes*!
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
You got worms.
Who?
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
What do I play?
Paine.
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
And to Don Quixote!
Waiter!
I'll cherish ya.
Tunnel?
Well, let's get going.
No--not offhand--
Take me home, Diz.
Why me?
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
He's a house-afire!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Henry Hill.
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
The--head?
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
What stuff?
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
Mr. President!
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
No, Jeff--please--!
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Jefferson--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
How's Amos, Ma?
Office of--Senator Smith?
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Did you say--bus?
Well--he's got nothing on me.
No. What had you better--?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Calendar?
It *is* not!
No--
Must have been tickled pink.
Second drawer.
Thanks a lot.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
I'm not.
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Goodnight, Senator--
Yes, sir--
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
What do you mean? What's going on?
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann--
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Susan!
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Go away, Nosey.
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
You're the best nurse I can think of--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Do you?
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
He did it.
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
It's crucifying him--!
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Some people like it.
Deeds?
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Yes, you own it.
Always.
Yes, indeedy.
He sure is.
No, no children.
I haven't.
Your Honor!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Yes, but I
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
What's that got to do with it?
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Oh, I don't mind.
I enjoy it.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
He did?
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
I don't blame you.
No. It's nothing.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Yeah, then what?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Hello . . .
I tell you that dame's nuts.
John
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
Oh, yes sir.
Me sir?
I wanna see that guy!
Better wire him right away, John.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
You can't?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Okay.
Yes.
Who - me? No.
No, thank you.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Why should you?
Nah.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Entertainment?
What're you talking about?
Oh.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Me?!
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
No, I mean - about my client.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
Take the stand!
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
I don't know.
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
Excuse me. What did you say?
You're Walter, aren't you?
I just wanted to make sure.
Prairie? Oysters?
Me more than most.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
How did they threaten you?
Really? You think so?
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
What's that?
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
Were you supposed to have a session?
Ernest, what do you think?
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
...And I from Phyllis.
Right now?
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
What kind of doubts?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Henry!
Now we're back on track.
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
And the experiment is in here?
Do you want to come in?
Oh, I don't know...
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
Doc.  Ainge...
It's a pretty piece of land.
...so accomplished.
Okay.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Sure.
That would explain it.
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
Mumford... like the town?
Mother... go away!
What do you mean?
Could I see Sofie, please?
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Hmm.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
Is she against you getting help?
Where?
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
I don't know if --
Of course.
Of course.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
You're upset.
I'm glad.
I don't follow you.
Which show was that?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
But...
What?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Anything... just ask.
Will you be here?
It's a big part of the show.
Was it something that happened at school?
How are you?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
Good-looking woman.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Uh-huh.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Jerking off?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Everybody has a story, Skip.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
That'd be Lily.
All new people start with that...
You're completely reliable.
You want my advice? Far out!
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
What'd I do?
Yep.
When?
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Relax, I got him.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
You're not going to kill us?
In the desert? What for?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
What friend? You're my only friend.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
Twenty.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
No, I mean --
What did you find? What did you see?
Really want to know?
I know my treasure.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
The things that get you excited.
What are those mirrors for?
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
How?
Because that's my name.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Yes?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
I was mistaken.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Way to go, Evy.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Still...
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Read the inscription on the cover!
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
Really?
One last tweak.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
When was that?
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
I thought you'd never ask.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
What did he mean?
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Get on to yourself!
Think positive.
Ummm.
I got it.
You're dead.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
I'm not that kind of girl.
Roy.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Not tonight.
Alone tonight?
Why?
What are you talking about?
What?
Yes.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos!
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
But I just don't feel it.
Not a chance!
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
See ya tomorrow.
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Oh shut up.
Yes.
Yes.
We're superheroes.
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Oh hi, Mom.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
But... the silverware?
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Who are they?
Are you sure he's still alive?
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Properly arranged, yes.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
I'm not insulted.
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
Bertrand, sire.
No, sire... I was asleep.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Ajaccio.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
I see...
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
It is the work of incendiaries.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I'll have the fire built up.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
No...
You must not act impetuously.
Well, you shall see.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Yes.
No.
I know what you're doing in there.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Five minutes.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
It's me.
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
There's probably some explanation.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
Yes, I wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Of course, my dear.
No.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
That is correct.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
That is a matter of opinion.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
Yeah.
You paid cash?
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Why you say that?
I don't know!
Don't move me.
What about the dog?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
You don't know Baby D.
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Okay, plan B.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Still gonna smell it.
Out the door and to the left.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
Naw, you go first.
No, man, just wait.
What about me?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
What are you doing here?
Okay.
Hold on.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
It's alright.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
I'll remember.
Have you seen Day-Day?
I saw it.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
I don't know.
Thanks for the help.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
What?
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Nothing.  What you want?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
I got my mase.
What's the matter?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
San Diego.
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
That's right.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
I would also like to apologize.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
Tell me why I miss him.
Keep your voice down.
That's right. That gives you...
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
No...kisses to you.
No, kisses to...
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
I remember. The big tipper.
That's right.
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
Don't think I won't.
Hi.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
I think this is worth a dollar.
What?
Everybody does?
Shut up.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Young love.
Only you.
No.
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
You, Preacher?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Dad, you're bleeding...
Yes, Dad.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
She went.
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
All to pieces!
A man of the Cloth?
Bluebeard!
Tricked us!
The money, Icey.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
Why?
That's Daddy!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
Up river.
I mind you said there was two.
He ain't my Dad.
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
It -- she --
No.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
Yes; from the first night.
Our honeymoon.
I -- no, I --
Yes.
Didn't you hear me, boy?
Them kids!
None of your business, Madam.
What?
Thank God.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Haven't slept, have you?
Slept like a rock.
Uh-oh...
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Yeah.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Just want to talk to him a second.
You know he's dead though, right?
Sure, but...
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
I don't mean her --
Krueger.
It wasn't that serious...
Right home after. See you.
I won't.
I will.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
Right.
Okay.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
S'curity.
Dead and gone.
So he's alive?
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
You were screaming like crazy.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
He's nuts about you.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Jungle man fix Jane.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Naturally, Comrade.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Just for the honeymoon.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Possibly.
That's right.
That's another thing... it's spring.
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
What is it?
And they might believe her in Moscow.
How many families live here with you?
Monsieur.
Which part of the room is mine?
That's right.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
The Duchess...
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
Good morning, Gaston.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Go to bed.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
No, sir.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
Yes.
Certainly.
Thank you, Louis.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
It is Thursday!
It's a real Paris reunion.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
Get out of here!
Comrade.
Comrade.
Two thousand francs.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
But you had!
I think so too.
Why should I take a chance?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
No.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
I don't have to but I find it natural.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohème... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
He takes good care of that.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
What?
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
Yes.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
Anything, Ninotchka.
I promise... I swear.
My darling.
And General Savitzky.
A funny story?
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
Darling, darling... please!
Shhh! Shhh!
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
No. Nobody will find us.
Much happier.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
But I can throw it out of the window.
...but big.
Who cried that one?
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Good morning, Swana.
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Huh?
No... please...
Months, Swana.
No thanks, Swana.
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
Has done what?
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Why?
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Yes.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
I don't understand.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
This will do.
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
So ... let's go ...
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
I'll bet he would.
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
I figured that out.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Jesus!  Through a window?
He wants money.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
'Night, Al.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
Sir?
That fruitcake!  What about him?
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
What do you mean, sir?
Silence!
"Security" is not strong enough.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
All right.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
Jesus!
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
Money.  Follow the money.
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
Let him finish, Bob.
I believe you're right, boss.
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
Yes, Mother ...
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
What ... ?
Harold ... can I get you anything?
My friends call me "Mister President."
Yes ...
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
We'll see about that.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Looks can be deceiving ...
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
I like jazz ...
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
Yes, I understand that.
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
Yes, yes.
Well, we could delete it.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
Are you serious?
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
And then you'll be happy?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
They were for me.  They're mine.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Most don't.
Uh-huh.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Nothin'?
Some pretty bad people.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
I don't know...
No. Probably I don't.
Gun out and up.
I'm hidin' behind you.
Sheriff?
Wasn't no bullet.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
Yes Sheriff.
I always am.
Well. If you say so.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Well I didn't see it.
...I need to sit down.
No. But I gave my word.
To your husband.
At the gettin' place.
No. I found it.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Just keep it up.
Yeah.
Goin' out.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
You should be used to that.
You know what's goin' on?
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Not a bleep.
So what're you goin' up there for.
I seen you was from Dallas.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
I was just passin' the time.
With what?
See about closing.
Well...
You've lived here all your life?
You married into it.
Everything.
Sir?
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Uh-huh.
That's twenty-six dollars.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Yessir. I understand that.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I'm a welder.
I didn't say braze.
No sir.
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
No, Elden, I need to...
Yeah?
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
We think we know where Betty is.
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
No, I didn't have to.
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
Oh. How come?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I don't think I am.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
You're late, Eric.
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
Did you love it?
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
Like Rome?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
What? Where was he?!
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
Where are you going?
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
Hell of a way to die.
What 'look'?
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
What?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
Oh, five years, give or take.
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
...who doesn't?
He's waiting...
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I said I'll think about it.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
She's a lesbian.
"A Reason to Love."
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Waitaminute -
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Where's Tommy?
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Now Penny, stop that!
Uh-huh.
Well sure, honey, but...
Isn't it, uh...
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
I been calling for four months.
Great.
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
What for?
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
I never said any of that!
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
A long time ago.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
Pity you don't have the character.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Aw screw it...
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
How're you doing, Sarge?
No, sir!
Zack, don't!
Yes, sir!!
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
I got my foot on the floor.
Yeah... Mmmm...
I haven't made up my mind.
What do you mean?
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
Be a friend. Leave.
You're better than candy.
It sure was.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
A little.
But it can't wait.
But she expects you to marry her?
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Not with me.  Not with people.
God.
That's right.
I have the gun.
I can't...
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
Are you gonna open the safe?
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
You finish.  Then we finish.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
This was your department, Junior.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Different tables.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
Huh?
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
Not at all.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
How many more do we have after this?
The furniture guy?
Open the door.
Well, I know that now.
People.  In the house.
It doesn't work?!
Say fuck.
I am.  I'm here.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Huh uh.
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
What are doing with yours?.
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
I got you.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Man, fuck you!!!
No man. PE -- "political education."
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
So talk...
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
Yeah.
I'm down.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But...
Right on Brother Judge...
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
All of the above, man...  And then some.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
You don't look alright.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I don't know. I really don't.
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
No.
I expect to try.
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
You got me beat on both accounts.
He's my father.
As do you.
My pleasure, sir.
Apology accepted.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
I consider them linked.
Are you going to meet with him?
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Yes.
You're in no condition to ride.
It's already over.
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
Yes...  ... father.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
He left us.
It's Mister Marion.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
Long time.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
Goodbye, Harry.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Four, five miles.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Yaay!
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Yayyy!
Well, I thought it was safe--
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Not at all.
Allman Brothers.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
I think it is so, Ellie.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Yes.
I don't know.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Is there quicksand?
Yes.
This babe has said enough.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
You don't understand--
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
It's beautiful!
I just said--
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
You're doing fine.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
Louis, are you sure?
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
Aye, aye, sir!
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
That's right.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
Men!  Are you up for it?
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household.
Can I trust you?
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Will -- you can't trust him.
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
Ceremony?
About the day we met. Do you remember?
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Me!
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
What?  He never told me that.
How did he get off the island?
We're not going to just surrender!
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Indeed.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
Pirate.
How?  The key's run off.
Agreed!
We need to go!
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
Barbossa.
It's the right way.
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Yes.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Nebbleman.
That remains to be seen.
No, Icky, this is real.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
The trunk.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
What did he want?
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
So, I guess it worked.
You know, this and that.
Same old Daniel.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
Susan, this is the future of America here.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
We don't?
The waste.
Three days ago it was.
That's right.
You're the doctor.
No, why?
What about it!
The nanobot... it's not here...
Getting used to it.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
Like a glove.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
I have to!
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
Oh yes you are!
The question is, are you?
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Goodbye, Stew
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
No? Why not?
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
For what?
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Gallagher?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Your house?
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Yeah?
With me you can always do business.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Yes, sir.
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
Sure.
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Dawson, sir.
I beg your pardon, sir?
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
I bet.
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
I didn't run away.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Must be my wife.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Been where?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Conrad.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
Holy jumping swordfish!
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
She did?
Have you seen this?
I understand, sir.
Now the lady said you may go
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Yes, sir.
No, sir!
I just putter.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
A bird in a gilded cage?
Very good, sir.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
What?
It can't be possible.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
No ... They won't be able to tell.
Thanks ... I love you.
I think it looks nice.
She's crying.
Yes she is.
Yeah. It does.
I don't want it to go away.
No I'm not sweetie.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Oh, gosh no.
You want to get out of here?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
I think ... I might be ill ...
It is?
What are you doing?
It's better, Mary Sue.
She won't go out with me?
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Rain.
Yes I did.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
The other one?
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
No way.
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
You--you gotta get us out of here.
What's going to happen?
We're supposed to be in school.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
As a matter of fact he does.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
I just don't think we have the right to ...
It's okay.
That's great.
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
... Lover's Lane?
Rain.
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
It was a prop for the school play ...
I'm not sure.
No I won't. I swear.
I like it too.
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
Nice ... Nice ...
Ooomph?
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
I can't.
Oh--well ...
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
Why?
No you're not.
Just gimme the damn remote!
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
Forget about that!
... What's that?
I brought you something ... From the library.
TV repair?
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Hey.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
I'm sorry.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
I....please don't do this.
I just want to know where she's staying.
Hi, is this Jack?
Are you watching a porno movie?
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
No.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
You don't even know how much it is.
....what....?
We got disconnected before....
I know I did. But I don't.
This is not cool.
No.
Thank you.
No. Not at all. It's nice.
It's terrible, no.
Sure.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
No, no. I did.
So that was your pudding?
Nothing.
...yes I did...?
Yes? I'm trying.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
If you come to Hawaii --
What do you mean?
Yes.
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
yeah.
This really looks like Hawaii here.
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
For what?
You left me at the hospital.
Did you do it?
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
That's fine.
......and this is confidential?
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
Barry Egan.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
I think you have a call?
....I have seven.
Hi Walter.
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
Fine, thank you.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
It takes time to process --
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
....yes.....
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Ok.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
What?
Please don't do this.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Are you serious with this?
Are you going to the party tonight?
What time are you gonna be there?
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
I'll see you there.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Nothing.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Sorry.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
Yes, Abbe?
Mustn't do that, sir.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
You always do.
His rug.
Coulmier, you animal!
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
-- that was lust --
His wife's influence.
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
Well...?
Do you favor its publication?
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
Shut down?
No. It most certainly was not.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
And my own.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
Quite.
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
There's something else I want from you.
Is it awfully violent?
It's only been described to me. In your books.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
Go on, child.
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
I pray you: be succinct.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
....shame on you, truly...
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
You've come to lecture me?
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
My name is Orson Welles
Over at RKO?
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
You needn't use that language with me
You will not walk out on me
I will not have this in my home.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
How so?
Yes?
I can't remember the lines!
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Right-
Like a bug.
The old man has his own way of doing things
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Orson, please ... it's too bright
Okay, boy wonder, what?
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
Orson. Stop. Just stop
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
But it's not a great syllable
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I don't care.
I don't give a shit about-
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
Christ.
Kinda.
George...
Yeah, ain't it swell?
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
Herman.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Yes
Again
Again
The ad..
Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
It was a -joke, George
It was fun, wasn't it?
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
No, I just told you what happened.
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
Whatsa matter with you?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
You sound bitter.
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
What time is it?
Should I hit it?
Can you see it?
No.
Oh, Jake.
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
I'm not interested in him.
What did I say?
Positive.
"Father of the Bride."
With Salvy, eh?
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
Are you drunk?
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
C'mon, Tommy --
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
All right, I'll try. See you later.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
He has it. Thank you.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
That's what they call a family problem.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
Thanks.
I think they missed their chance with her.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
Your Lisa?
I told you that --
A possibility.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
It's me.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Why should I?
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
How did you know!
I was.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
And some man will lose his.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
You called the police?
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
What?
You can tell that from here?
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
I wish there was one I wanted.
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard?
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
You mean "goodnight."
Without any future?
I have one now.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
What's the apartment house number?
What about it?
I don't know.
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
How?
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Know the Millertown bluff?
Hi.
Okay.
Yeah.
And you dropped it?
Shoot, Jimbo.
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
I was in it.
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
You don't?
Sorry.
Sure.  Sure.
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Stay here.  That was my son!
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
Head-shrinker?
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
I'll wait for him.
What?
I just don't want trouble.
No.  In the morning.
Who knows.  Plato?
What's a chickie-run?
Who's that!
We know.
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
Man, you're schizoid!
Who?
I'm here.
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
What do you think?
My gun?
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Goodbye, dear.
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Listen--
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
You were looking for me, weren't you?
No.
I felt like it.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
I bet you hear everything I say!
Hi.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
It is for me too.
Yes.  My best friend.
Okay.
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
He hates me.
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
Gabriel!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
No, baby. He wants me.
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Yeah.
No, hey, I like your coat --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
Nick, no --
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
What?
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
What?
Part of... with them?
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
They all are. Football's on.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
Yes!
I never worked at no casino.
A station wagon in Canada.
Hey.
Five million?
Christmas... Eve...
I said, who the hell made the map?
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Might as well be.
At least gimme video poker.
I'm gonna need some money.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
'Tis the season, convict.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
How'd you know my name...
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
How'd you know my name.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
What... Powwow...
I don't steal any --
Where is he?! Where is he?!
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
Mr. Bangs.
What?
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Five years. Since it opened.
Hi, Nick.
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
It's a roach, guy --
Yeah.
I'm just talking.
Thought you hate your old man.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Alamo...
GUARD!!!
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
What? No...
I'm ninety-two years old --
There is no other table --
Now where were we?
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
You ain't dying, he is.
Where was she from, Compton?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
What?
Bullshit.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
This better not be some Freddy joke.
Did the two of you talk?
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
What for?
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Sure.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
How many employees?
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Like hell I am.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
Fuck all that.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
He ain't dead.
I think he's just passed out.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
He asked.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
You takin' his side?
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
His letters will keep.
Thanks.
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
What?
I suppose that's my fault.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
I haven't got the job yet.
Which ranch?
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
A little hot.
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
A man I used to know.
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
All right. I'll tell you.
That's right, Steve.
I won't again.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
You want to split up? --
What's there to be fair about?
I said I didn't care.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Then why stay in the hills.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Go ahead.
They went on like I told you.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
Now where's she goin'? --
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
He certainly could. About a month.
Stop it --
I don't know -- I don't know.
Lookin' around.
I sure would.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Would they be good to eat?
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
But you're his brother.
Oh, sure.
Thanks, Steve.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
Wife?!
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Would you die already?!
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
Hey, I have an idea...
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
Hello Ray.
Okay.
No. I never date outside my race.
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Huh?
Can you feel that?
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Then what are we going to do?
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Not in a thousand years.
Yes!!!!
I'll go.
My child, you're alive!
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
How are we going to get them all up there?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Just a little Rogaine.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Yours, or the turkeys?
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
"Fucked me."
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
I don't feel like rewinding it!
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
Let me see!
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
That's right.
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey.
We can be real quiet...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Oh, honey!
I certainly did.
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
GODDAMN YOU!
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
I didn't do it!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
I do, please.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
He's a good boy.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...
Where?
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
She can only use cash.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
"The Dante?"
But I like teaching school.
Thank you.
I ought to know.
I did her hair.
She showed me a drawing.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Weren't you afraid?
But you do believe me?
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them.
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
We've tried so long to find her.
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
Good night.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
That you love Mary.
You will die.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I'm at sea, Jason.
I have to go -
And Gregory -- he loves her.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
Uhhuh.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
Tell me what?
Perhaps
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
I haven't said anything of the sort.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
I'm afraid not.
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
Yes  and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Sister older or younger?
I feel like they do.
Agreed.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
You had sex with you therapist?
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Maybe you want to go.
I know.
She said it on her tape.
Why not?
What difference does it make why I do it?
I have money.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Do you want me to stop?
Yes.
You said you weren't always impotent.
How come?
Why not?
Not entirely.
Possibly.
I don't know.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
You did that?
Who'd you have lunch with?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Is that supposed to comfort me?
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
Yeah, so?
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Is he still at your house?
Yes.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Why, so you can go after him?
Do you have to say that?
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
Let me talk to him first.
And... do whatever it is you do.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Why not?
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
But why did you want to?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
You are in serious trouble.
No.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
You want me to leave?
Nope.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
I just want to ask you questions.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
Very much live.
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Different.
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
Cynthia. John.
You know what I mean.
Right now.
Cynthia. John.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
What's so stupid about it?
You trust him.
Did he put you up to this?
Graham.
God, you... you're mean.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
No.  You said three-fifty?
You have family here also?
I like having the car, the car is important.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
So is my wife, asshole!!
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
My keys?
Goddamit...
Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
Yeah.
All right, jesus.
Was he nice to you?
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Yes.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
We live in 703.
Gonna cut me open?
I don't get it.
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
A wreck.
Time to check with Flavors.
You got it!
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
He was a President.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
He was adopted you know.
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Of course.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
I'm sorry, Officer.
No...couldn't I do this later?
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
I don't think he intends to go that far.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
Good. That's good.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
I love you.
And?
Gary.
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
They're just leftovers.
Oh yeah.
Not so bad yourself.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
No, I'm an actor.
Well, in that case...
You said you had it all lined up.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Oh yeah. Much better.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
I'd rather have a knife.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
I owe her a call anyway.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Want some?
Pour us a couple.
You know her?
She is very hot.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
Shut up.
Miles.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
Well, she is cute.
Nah. I want to watch this.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Aye-aye, captain.
Bathroom.
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Could be anything.
Shut up.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
You have to tell me --
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
No.
What's that?
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Hold on.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
I'll pay for it.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
The Windmill.
Try it.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
Hey.
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Yeah. Thanks.
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Yeah.
Got it.
Good. So did I.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Well, nice to see you now.
Okay.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Victoria.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
So what's happening with your book?
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
She doesn't answer me either.
That's weird.
...I will.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
Are you going to do this or what?
Yes, it was.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
I'm looking!
Yes.
Don't do it.
Who wrote this book?
The footprints.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
It's like War of the Worlds.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
Your next water ain't for three days.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
Right.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Which way do you mean?
He is that.
Anybody got any ideas?
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
Believe it.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
He is now.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
We'd rather stay.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
Rae, I need help.
Why would they stop you?
Because they enjoy it.
You don't know?
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
It's been a while.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
Give me some of the good stuff.
What do you mean?
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
She'll drive herself.
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
What about it?
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
Better late than never.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
Excuse me?  Start?
Not quite.
I want you back too, Viktor.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
How much wine have you had?
No... it's life.
Because obviously she existed, right?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
Do what you do to Simone.
Is that a problem?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Clyde.
Body double.
Why not?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I know what you mean.
-- Please, get away from me.
I was misquoted.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
I need flesh and --
You do?
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
This week anyhow.
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
Precisely.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
I could get the death penalty.
It's a yacht.
I'm keeping it in trust.
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Don't you?
Dark?
24-hour tail on Taransky?
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Taller, Viktor.
Thank you.
Good.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
... digitized.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
--Do I know you?
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Dr. Crowe.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
Look over there.
I don't tell her a thing.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
Upset words.
Something I want?
I forgot myself.
Dr. Crowe.
Your eyes told me.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
What?
Don't fail me.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
No, we're not.
No.
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
Maybe.
Lots of things.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
Don't get mad.
Yeah.
They did?
They want me to do things for them.
What?
I know.
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
It's our pleasure.
Chuck E. who?
J. C. Penny's?
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
Alright!
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Which street corner?
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
No shit.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Bus broke down.
I thought you said two hundred.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Harvest moonshining!
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
I don't think so.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Who you callin' "boy?"
He's right. You were behind.
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
About what?
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
Let it go.
I said that's enough!
Look. You want to talk about this?
You never had trouble communicating before.
It's you. You and your father.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
Shelby!
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
What can I do you for?
How many you need?
All the rib eyes?
Out.
My present?
Okay.
Grant, you're sick!
Hey, look!
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Your what?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
You know how rumors start.
You paying for the gas?
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Shoot.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
You could've asked.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
And?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
I'll do it.
You sure do.
No.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Yeah?
Redneck heaven.
They're jammed!
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
What's your twenty?
I'm at marker eight-five.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
What's that, pardner?
Go head on, breaker.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
Of course. Yes.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
You woulda?
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
I'm not doing cocaine.
That's not possible. I told you.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
Look at the collar on that coat...
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
Without peer?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
-- will be handled back in --
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
-- okay, g'head --
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
None whatsoever.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
Got hit twice.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
What's the time frame?
Can it work?
You're not Gibarian...
Yes.
Why did you agree to come here?
Not her.  It.
No, she won't.
He's dead.
Where's Sartorius?
Why, who did you see?
Who was it?
How much sleep?
Shut up.
And professionally?
I don't know.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Just get him to stop.
Her oxygen would have run out.
Into what?
I love her.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
Why?
Book?
Stop it.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
What kind of look?
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Do you?
Gibarian.  He was here.
It's all right.
You should have told me.
I want you here.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I want to stop taking those pills.
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
Please.  Don't.
We want to talk freely.
It's an experiment.
Queens... You know Queens?
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
I came on at 8:00.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Urdu and Hindi.
Could be, I guess.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
Absolutely.  Look at this.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Claire...!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
They called here after you left...
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
Oh God, that's great!
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Do you dance?
I know.
Yeah...
Listen, I'll... see you again.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Sure we are, let's go!
Your what...?
You don't want to hear about it.
Why?
I might stop you.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
It's not your taste.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
I'm all right.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Ever shot anyone?
No, sir...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
I'll prove it!
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
I know where everything is.
Yeah, I think so.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Nonot really.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Don't be pitiful.
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Mr. Jameson--
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Hmf-hrr?
Thank God.
I've gotta study.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
I know what you mean.  I...
Strong...
Why?
Nah.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
See?  You big dullard.
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
Really, Professor, I--
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
I don't think I'll be running into him.
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Phooey on that.
Is you all good Nazis?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Who is it?
How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
We're looking at it.
You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
You are talking crazy!
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
It's on me.
Abfuehren!
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Some are not bad at all.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
Stop it, Harry!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
What's the award?
No?
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
I'll open mine, too.
It's that song, Harry!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
Yes, sir.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
I called it the last time, didn't I?
You did!
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
What's the decoy?
Give this to Joey, will you?
Thirty-fifth.
What did you say?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Ich weiss alles.
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
Yes, you do!
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
HoS qorDu.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Why would you want to leave?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
It's our pleasure.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
Better?
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Phasing? To where?
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
What do you want?
I was ordered to by the Captain.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
Make it so.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
David... Sorry I'm late.
David!... What went wrong?
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
Underground deposit?
... Or <u>who</u>.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
None that I can detect, sir.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
Just him, sir!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
What? What are you saying?
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Any time.
Torpedoes coming in -- !
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
... The needs of the few...
... Spock...
Yes... But -- how...?
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
I have my orders.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
Carol!
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
But we can't just sit here -- !
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
What do you want with us? I demand --
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I see. Helmsman?
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
I'm Doctor Marcus!
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
We appear to have plenty of time.
Only half of you would get there.
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Rake her.
I shall avenge you --
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
Aye, sir --
Admiral, this is Spock.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Yes, SIR.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
To be sure, Captain.
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
It would explain a great many things --
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Best we could do in two hours.
Uhura, patch me in --
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
It is still regulation, Admiral.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Who?
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
All stop, sir.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Aye, sir.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Visual.
Scotty!
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
Where must you go?
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Fine. Just fine.
Yeah.
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
We've done it before.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
What do you think, Spock?
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
... My God...
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
It is.
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
What's what?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Why does it have to be goodbye?
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Explain.
But you said toxic.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
I will, Admiral.
Weapons systems?
Steady as she goes...
... Aye sir...?
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Aye, sir!
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
On my way...!
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
... Yes?
... Are you joking?
Just use the keyboard...
Tell her I feel fine...
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
You're what?
I understand.
Perhaps, that is true.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Really?
Sometimes I do.
For what purpose?
No one's ever asked me that before.
No.
The artificial lifeform was right?
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
Yes. But look at this medscan...
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
From the mission...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
May I talk to you alone?
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
Deck ten.
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
No, we're here to... rescue them.
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
Why was Data assigned?
Good question.
No children?
Or you could try lying down.
... I believe you...
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
Bag him.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
I do not know what you are referring to.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
What?
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
I told you, there's no --
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
How serious is the damage?
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
As they used to say... all systems are go.
One minute to warp threshold...
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
California. San Francisco.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
The invasion plans.
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
Yes, he is.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
That's impossible.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Fire.
Aye, sir.
Go to manual.
Onscreen.
Life signs?
Unless you'd like to stay.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Understood!
Nothing.
Hold that thought.
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Target...
Vulcans sleep lying down...
That's the question -
I wish I knew. Uhura?
Can you - ?
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
If they're even looking for us...
She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
Now there's a poser.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
They'll make it look like an accident...
Very much.
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
Yes.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
Now we go to Starfleet?
ALL uniforms?
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
Anything else you want to tell me?
Where do we come in?
Possibly.
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Sir?
You hear that?
Sulu!
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
You have personally -
I was asked by my father to open neg-
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
So, that's it..
What peace conference?
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
Spock, you want to know something?
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
I don't want to.
Confirmed, Captain!
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
No.
I know.
No.
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
Sorry, sir.
It'll only work for one of us.
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
With pleasure, Captain.
And I you.
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
Counselor?
No!
This isn't real.
You sick bastard!
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
Do you have life support?
Theories?
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
He wants to look me in the eye.
Sir?

Understood.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Your new chair, sir.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
She's a predator.
Can anything be done for him?
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
How did you end up on Remus?
New worlds.
I know.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
In time.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
We are.
You know that's not possible.
Long ago.
He is what his life has made him!
But you want to.
I am.
On my way.
It is... invigorating.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
A matter of hours now.
They will obey, Praetor.
I came this far alone ...
I have a purpose.
Silence, Romulan!
Praetor.
I don't think so...
It is beautiful.
Thank you.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
About five miles back.
They must have picked it up in space.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
It's taken on a disguise.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
Shermin...
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
What.
What.
Money.
No gas.
Gas good?
I am Jenny Haydn.
I know.
Shit... shit... what shit?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
Candy.
A drink.
You better.
I do not understand.
I need you.
Is that a baby?
Do you have a baby?
The car will stop?
Yes.
What?
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
Yes?
Yes. Sing some more.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Nothing.
Horses.
Do they talk?!
Yes, they are.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
I understand.  Thank you.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
I understand.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
No, thank you.
Where?
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
You could have killed us both!!
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
No.
Wait'll you see it.
Was there visual contact?
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
Twenty-eight years.
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Judy, that's stupid.
You know that's impossible!
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
Leave him alone, Tran.
You're going down.
Fuck you.
Forget it's there.
No, Lenny.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
He records himself raping and killing her--
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Only way I could stand your ties.
You bet.  Did you like it?
I won't say anything.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
Naawww.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
She never gave me a tape.
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Strickland.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
You'll see.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
Black.  Jack.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
So that gives you something.
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
I'm not going.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
You never told me.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
No, sir.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
This isn't in our database?
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
What?
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Not as much as you'd think.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
Why me? What do you want from me!?
Yes.
Put a BOLO out on that.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
How long ago?
I was visiting an old college friend.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Does Koessler ask about me?
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
That's true.
Jaime? Where are you?
What's up?
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
Yeah, of course.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
I already have an employer.
Those were just fantasies.
Yeah.
Lead the way, Murman.
[Not the heart, the watch.]
[What does the file say?]
So you're the new meat?
I screwed up twice, sir.
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
The same.
I don't know about that.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
What do you drive?
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
You better pay the man.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Why? You're not a real man?
How was it hard?
What what? What advantages?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
...Four days..?
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
What an asshole.
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
No matter what... like splitting aces.
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Sorry?
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Why not?
Six years.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...get the hell outta here already...
Hi, Mike?
Are you on the other line?
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
Fine... I guess. You?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
There's the rub.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
What do you want? You're tall.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
What'd you get?
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
I just tested for one...
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
I didn't make it...
Sure.
You always know the right thing to say.
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
I don't know...
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
You think they're watching?
Let's just leave.
Let's go.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
No! Not the camera guy!
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
Michelle went for you, right.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
What?!?
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
Yeah. You met him once.
...through the kitchen...
What?
We're not messing with you...
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Chelios to Roenick...!
You could make their heads bleed, though.
...How novel.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...it is so on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
...just be smart about it.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
I ask for Justice.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
You understand him better than anyone.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
And with prison record.
Should I bring him in.
I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
Barzini.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
Then why have I become a man like you?
How did you find out?
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Where are you going?
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
No.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
Okay.  One minute.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
You know I love spaghetti.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
How do you do.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
No.
I'm thinking about it.
How is your father?
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
When will I see you again?
Don't you want dinner first?
How's Mom?
Until the old man tells me different.
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
Yes, I promise.
I do wish to be baptized.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You just woke up!
Well, we ate everything without you.
Did you speak to my father?
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Yes please!
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
What? What's this?
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
What?
This is so good of you.
Copy out from here...
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
What club?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
Ripley's plans.
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
What?
I love Marge.
What evening?
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
Such as?
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Bird. That's jazz.
So I'm learning.
What about Cortina?
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Dickie did it.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
Get on. I'll take you to him.
To the manner born.
And you, sir? Any better?
What?
I can explain.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Why? When?
I don't believe you.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Do you know Tom?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
Excuse me?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Randall.
Is Freddie in Rome?
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
I'll take them both.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Hello Meredith.
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
I give up.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Was who Meredith?
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Yes?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Of course. What happened to your face?
November, I thought.
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
My name is Travis.
I can believe that.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
I bought a couple of tickets.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
My God!
Hello, Betsy.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
You sure he's not Italian?
Show me how he did that again.
What is it? I'm busy.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
And what happened?
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
In the jungle. 122nd.
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
That's what you think.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Huh?
He shoots dope too.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
My work may take me out of New York.
Yes I am.
Why, thank you Travis.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
I can't sleep nights.
You want to work uptown nights?
Education?
Why?
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Things got ya down?
You know how I feel about what you do.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
Don't let him do that.
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Delly?  In here.
Well...
... including me.  Right?
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
You must not remember anything. Come on.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Nothing.
I'm  fine.  Really.
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
Oh...
Oh.
Have you got a cigarette?
I don't smoke?
Exactly.  And he got good.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
I do.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
Can't wait.
Yes?
Yes.
The film broke...
Did you... did you...
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Anybody take it?
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
No, sir.
She's very pretty.
Aren't you coming?
Huh?
I... I don't believe this.
Who the hell is this "they?"
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
I was decorated.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
No thanks.
Well, that's not what they think.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
No, I...
What?
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
Yeah... me too.
The customers?  I don't know...
Oh.
Oh...
What exactly did you hear?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
No. Just a few hours.
Yes.
Thank you.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
If you have some, I'd...
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
Different?
A trifle.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
That's up to you.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Cathy!
No!
Well, I suppose...
Your brother told me.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Mmmm.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Yep?
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
We'll make our own fog.
They're back!
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Yes.
I got them all, Mother.
That's a chance we have to take.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
But they'll be back.
If they are?
No, not exactly.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Did you close the door?
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Monday?
Are they moulting now?
How can you tell?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I am.  Good day.  Madam.
Criminal.
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Yes?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
Seven o'clock then.
Famished.
Oh. That. Rome.
Yes, I was lying.
I told you what happened in Rome!
Cheers.
Like what?
What'll it say?
No, tell me.
No, I have my things in the car.
No, thank you.
Hear, hear!
With my little sparrow leading team.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
...everything I know.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
The bay doesn't.
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
How about you?
And he'll talk?
Yes.
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
Do you have any lovebirds?
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
What were the crows after at the school?
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Maybe! Is it impossible?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
How?
With smoke.
Can we go on living here otherwise?
That would hardly be possible.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
I remember her.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
I am the best man for the job.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
Get out of here!
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Yes.
Only Brother.
Burke them?
I come from Lisbon.
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
Nearly a year.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
I'll get him.
I'm looking for my friends.
Tell her... we'll get him.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
Keep that thing away from me.
I don't know you, man.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
Nobody.
I know her friends.
Your father gave them to both of you.
Someone else did it.
He didn't kill her.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
Yeah, I know.
Yes I do, I really do.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
I know the guy leaves a sign.
You mean Alex.
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
Not tonight. Honest.
What did I say?
Watch out!
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
He'll be there at 8:30.
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
Would you care to be more specific?
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
I leave that in your hands.
No -- not at all.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
I assure you such power exists.
Yes.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Professor Barnhardt.
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
About five months -- your months.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
You still haven't answered my question.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
Is that what you're thinking about?
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
I -- I thought you were--
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
I'd give you a very good price.
You don't.
How long will that take?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
El Vampiro.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
What?...
Hey, take it easy.
I will, David!
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
What?
What happens in tow and a half hours?
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
Whatcha doin' over here?
I better get cleaned up, then.
No.  Just you.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Oh, no, you won't.
What's that smell?
He's already gone to bed.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
Well, I...
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
So do I!
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
No.  Why?
Don't bother.
Piss off.
Don't turn on the light.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
I don't know who to trust.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
The dogs?
Look, I'm just guessing...
What for?
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Come on, Copper.
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
When was the last time you used it?
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
Well, stick to it.
I am going after them.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Move it, Palmer.
I ain't going with Sanchez.
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
He's dead.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
MacReady...?
Hear what?
What?!
And everyone looks like us?
This is it?
Excuse me?
Yes.
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
Yes.
End...?
I don't understand.
Alexander.
Created?
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
A man can change his history.
Because...
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
I -- what are you?!
Got here as soon as I could.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
A moonstone.
I need... to talk to you.
Not here... alone.  Please.
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
Alex, it's just the zoo.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
Do you know you were humming?
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Tonight's the night?
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Oh?
Perseverance.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Mm.
You're not from beyond the valley.
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
Thank you...
You can see so many here.
We share everything.
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Someone you loved very much.
Is it?
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
May I get you some --
Exactly correct, sir.
Imagine that.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
What are your people called?
New Yorkers.
I suppose so.
They've gone to a better place.
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
Kalen...
That's quite enough, Kalen.
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
In where?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
How?
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
You may have known my father, William Starks.
He didn't either.
That's too bad.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
I never touched your father! I swear!
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
You two ok?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
Jackie.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
What?
They're not.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
No, he didn't.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Maybe.
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
What for?
Who told you this?
No.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
See ya.
What?
What?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
A .38.
My Lord.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
What for?
Thelma?  It's me.
I'm a robber.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
You're a little angle, you are.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Who's your friend?
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
What the fuck is going on?
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Who is it?
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
Yes.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Yeah!
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
I think better when I drive.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
It's probably not a good idea.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
I won't wait up.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Yes!  I believe I am!
Yeah.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Just past Boise City.
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Now what what?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
We should have just ignored him.
Harlan.
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
You know why.  You already said.
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Yup.
Oh.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
You too, sweetie, the best.
All this for us?
Go?
Say you're sorry.
Grrrreat!
Fresno.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
I guess.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
I don't know.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
Uh-huh.
Yeah feels like it.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Mints?
Jesus Christ you're right.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Who?
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
'That right?
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Dumbshit.
No thanks.
Pat Healy.
Great.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Well, I know you're busy...
She's in a wheelchair?!
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Kim and I are close friends!
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
Who?
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
And you met Mary how?
Fucking sickening.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Really? I never got a message.
Oh... are you... ?
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Trying to be.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
All right, let's go.
Toy poodle!
Mary, come on...
Okay.
Really?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Shhhhhh!
What?! No please, sir --
I think a little of both.
No, that's really unneces --
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
Smoke.
I think it's a bad idea.
Yeah.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
An invasion...
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Not as far as the election goes.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
You're sure...
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
What journey?
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
Seven.
Jesus...
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Good.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
Thanks, Cooch.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Yes.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
No way, Cooch.
After we've completed our investigation.
You're steppin' on sign.
Bullshit.
Why should I tell you.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
What'd you expect to hear?
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
So they took care of Leo.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
I read, Cooch.
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
How the hell do you know?
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
Yeow!
That's all!
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
You let me make a fool of myself.
And far too aggressive.
I'm special.
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
What plane.
Used to what?
You're an animal.
It's not suffering anymore.
You always get what you want?
Anything.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
That's up to you.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
...Something like that.
Yes sir!
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
He better be kidding!
You.
You're crazy. We're level.
NO. NO GOOD.
Saving them some paperwork.
BREAKING LEFT!
Yawing right.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
280, 290, 300 knots.
Just relax.
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Like what?
No shit. The Iceman....
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
Let's go. Eject.
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
Just below ten thousand.
So have I.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
What the hell you doing?
Didn't everybody?
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Sir?
I lost.
I'm nothing like him.
What was that?  An accident?
Why not?
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Who are you?
Thank you.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
So why am I still alive?
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
It's about goddamn time.
What is it?
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Brunette.
Sleazy...and demure.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
Oh, Rekall.
Well don't.
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
Let me buy you a drink.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Up!
Come on!
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Yeah, sweetheart?
Oh God, Doug.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
I'm here at Rekall.
Bullshit.
Nice to meet you.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
What?
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Cannon fuse.
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Do not talk to the driver.
Well, sure.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
You're hung up again.
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
No ties.
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
You bet.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
Okay, ten dollars.
Around here?  Why would they?
You okay?
Why do you all keep asking me?
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
An hour after you picked it up!
True.
Where's the nearest hospital?
-- With objection!
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Sustained.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
No. No...
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Right. You're right.
Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
We're taking the other case.
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
"Have to"? No...
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
-- Roger -- ?
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
You're doing a murder case?
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
It was self-defense.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
Don Reynard.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
-- alleged crime --
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
No? Then what did he say?
-- Eddie told you?
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
-- Every word.
That's right.
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
And its purpose?
For control of the prison drug trade?
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
Blonde.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
Bobby...
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
Was there an argument?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
Anything else?
Stanley, I heard all about it.
Any friends?
Did she ever mention any friends?
What do you mean?
That's what I heard.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
It's late, Sam.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
I'll get my kit.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
He probably wanted to drive over.
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
Well, why not?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
WE got it back, that's all.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
Brother, I hear you talkin'.
No... No...
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
Not now.
I can't tonight.
You know it and I know it.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
...school's fine...
A friend from school.
Yes.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
That's right.
As if I didn't know.
I'm fine.
Nothing.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
And no one will know the truth.
What does it mean?
Yes.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
No.
No.
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Huh!
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Tell me one?
...We did everything we could...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
That's what I'd planned to...
No, you did fine.
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
Well...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
Yes. I wrote it.
What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
I've got to work.
You're talking like a drunk.
I...
No... no...
Kathy Price.
No.
I didn't do it, Mister.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
...I understand...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
I'm going to help her.
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
I can't talk now.
Read me what she said.
...one of the other nurses?
The 'History'...?
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
In New York?
Yes, that's correct.
Yes, the roving nurse...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
How'm I doing so far?
Should I?
Me, too.
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
But I think I know where she'll be....
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
It might give us something.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
D.O. to number three..come in.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
What?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Chase. Hi...
No.
No...
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
I like this story.
They were safe and could sleep.
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
They wouldn't let me...
What's that?
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Your father?
You miss him.
I am about this.
We were idealists.
I haven't forgotten.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Claiming their place in the world.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
Whatever.
Figured what out?
Me either.
That's not why he's sending me.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
It was a bad dream...
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
I know enough.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
How do you know?  They might.
Who?
All stop on the engine.
It was my fault.  I slipped.
They have every right Chuck.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
I know.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
And, of course, we are.
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
Yes sir.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
That's enough.
We'll think of something.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
I figured it out.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
What's that?
What?
You've gotta be kidding?
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
No.
I can't.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
It wasn't hard.
I am accountable.
Why? He's right in the groove.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
How old are you?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
No way... GET OUT!!!
What's that?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
She really say she was pregnant?
Have now.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Thanks.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Set one up.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't say, which one?
Hasta siempre.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
That bastard Pucinski...
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
What I made you do, mama?
Peanut...
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Here she goes again...
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
You tell the boy who knocked you up?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Hell, peanut...
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
You certain?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
You do.
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
You think she's gonna make it?
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
You sick?
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
And Bobby too, I hear...
Went with Bobby.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
What could I be up to, Lula?
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
What if I asked you not to?
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
No.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Yes.
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Well?...
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
Isn't she?
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Shut up and drink.
Where would we go?
Shit.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
His parents.
Maybe... I don't know.
So what's the problem?
Don't touch it.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Do you know he won't expel him?
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
You must be mistaken.
You did.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
And your wife left you.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
With Emily?
It's very convincing.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Miss Sloviak's.
Is he all right?
What's he saying?
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
What'd you tell him?
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Blocked.
Hm.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
So where have you been staying?
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Yeah, well, actually...
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
Kinship.
How can you tell?
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
I didn't mean it that way.
When nobody's looking.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Just checking.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
Oh. Well. I...
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
Who does?
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
Chancellor.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
All right. This morning --
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
You got me.
James Leer.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Are you sure you parked it there?
I think I might have.
I know, but sometimes...
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
Why yes. How did you know?
I'm not sure that's possible.
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
I was thinking of you.
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
I like the noise.
What?
Is it because of Anna?
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
What's that?
Next week? The week after?
Isn't it?
Sure.
Is that right?
You live around here?
Have a seat.
I have no idea.
Okay.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
I fell asleep.
Woodsman?
I went to bed around seven.
I could take you downtown.
'Fraid not.
I'm adjusting okay.
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
No you're not.
Do you have many friends?
Your daddy will always love you.
Robin, listen to me.
Will I see you again?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Reflect.
No fucking way.
Honest? No.
Forget it.
I don't feel anything.
Have to talk about something.
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
I don't.
Is this the first one?
I want you to calm down.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Sorry.
I'm relaxed.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
This is garbage!
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
Me?
Most women wouldn't choose it.
What?
I'll buy a plant.
I like the noise.
You must hate it.
I get that impression.
Why do you want to know?
You're still here.
The worst?
What?
Their power. They seduce me.
What odds?
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
Which brother did this?
What?
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Just think about it.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
You're such an asshole.
Piece of cake, baby.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
No way that could just be seawater.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
Wasn't up to me.
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Yeah.  So sue me.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
I don't know, look around.
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
God, I hate that bitch.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Why bring it here?
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
He's hallucinating badly.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
This one is gorgeous.
Four or five days.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
That seems to apply to you also...
How should I be ... arrogant?
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
And what about you?
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
What! Get married?
So, you wonder why?
Late, very late.
Tell me once more.
To do what?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
What do you mean by sensible?
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
Here I am.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
No. The owners are in Australia.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
Yes, we will.
They didn't seem too good.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Lady Patrizia!
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
You're kidding!
Is that possible?
You really must do me this one favor.
He talked to you Himself?
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
That's not what he meant.
Who?
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Why?
It made them holy.
No.
It's not that... it's not that...
I don't know... I don't know...
That wasn't me.
Everyone.
I love you.
Yes.
Yes.
The baby they made up.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Anything.
Not at the moment, no.
I don't know.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Not my fault.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
I'm always bad.
No...
I can't.
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
And then...
I'm afraid.
No I'm not.
Yes I am.
Because I'm in trouble.
No.
Because I was afraid.
No.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
I hate them.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
What do you think it's there for?
Are you ill?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Go away, I don't want you here.
No... don't hit me please...
Yes.
What did she mean?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Agnes who did you see?
Yes.
Who?
You got to be crazy.
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
If I find anything I'll call you.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
The one up on the third floor?
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
What business is it of yours..?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
So, someone else could have done it.
And in your eyes?
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
That possibility never occurred to you?
And what happened?
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
There's another choice.
About what?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
I don't think I care to know.
Oh, dear God.
Don't deny it!
The woman's health is at stake.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Nothing...
I'd love one.
Long, thin and filtered.
Begin what?
You're what?
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
How  ?
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Why would I lie?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
I don't know... too late to stop it.
The scandal...
That's a lie.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Shurrup!
Y'what?
What they like?
I'm a deserter, too.
Read 'em!
Yeah.
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
They'll be here.
Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Ta.
Yeah, grotesque.
A butcher?
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Wake up!
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
He comes from a large family.
Well, what happened?
How'd you guess?
Is it ... is it, really?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
What's that mean?
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Is she?
You can learn from books.
Out where?
Parading?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
I'm not wrong.
Have they?
Me!
Oh, they seem all right to me.
Eh?
What's he on about?
I'll look after meself.
Every morning.
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ...
But I'm clean.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Hiding.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Don't be callous.
Foreign devil ...
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Sit down, the lot of you.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
What?
Hello.
I would have said so.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
He'll get over it.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Y'what?
Don't exaggerate.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
Good lad, Ringo.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
It's not my fault.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ...
Nerves.
And they want me?
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
You were twanging too loud.
Cattle ranch!
Hell, we're equipped --
Kill drive engines.
That's what I'm going to do.
Is it solid?
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
You want to try?
No, I want to go in.
Take care.
Unknown.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Shit...
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Is it alive?
Damn it!  How long to fix?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
No, I don't want us separated.
How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
What do you mean?
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
How's Broussard?
How do we locate the creature?
Oh my God.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
It's time for drastic remedies.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as...
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
We're not going anywhere.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
We sure need this flamethrower.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
Let's let the machine work on him.
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Look --
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Found what?
What killed it?
Oh well... you know me.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
I guess we open the door and net it.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Who gets the privilege?
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
I'll get you out of there.
What can I do?
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Okay, give me the numbers.
We're what!?
We're not gonna make it, are we?
Get her on-line.  Now!
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
Do it.
But...
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
What's wrong?
Yeah, I...
It's alright, it's cool...
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Thanks.
Where does that lead to?
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
What is that?
You've checked that end?
Looks like it.
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
Please do.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
I'm in love with Lloyd!
... and Karen.
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
I don't know what I take you for anything...
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
Yes, Addison.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
And too many of them are produced.
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
Amen.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Of course I knew.
How nice.
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
Where?
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
Huh?
As of this moment you're six years old...
When - when are you coming back?
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
What?
It won't play.
Cut it out.
I had no idea you were even here.
That never stopped you before.
She's a girl of so many interests.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Twenty minutes!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
So full of meaning, fire and music!
Who?
Now don't get carried away-
I've been aware of that for some time.
Margo, let's make peace.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Why you have to go out there.
You didn't have to tell me.
Of course not.
It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
So am I.
You're quite a girl.
Of course!
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
Do you want an argument or an answer?
No.
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
What report? To whom?
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
Oh, no...
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
Try...
I'd like that.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
Let's not get over-dramatic.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
I wish I could believe that.
Something most important you can do.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Thank you, Karen.
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
There are other plays...
Well - if I'm not in the way...
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
You've what?
Three or four miles...
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
I just can't believe it.
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
I wonder why.
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
That was way back...
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
I mean really, deeply angry...
What's your being married got to do with it?
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Would you?
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Hmm.
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
--see?--
--fifteen phone calls--
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
When?
Go on, go on--
--we will--
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
Maybe we are...
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
Hmm?
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
I'm so glad.
You can't.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
--that was awhile ago--
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
There's always a later plane.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
I don't know what they'd do to me.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he?
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
--this'll only take one second--
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
Electronic surveillance.
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Mitchell knew then.
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
Government. Recently retired.
The C.I.A.
It may never come out.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
Anyone but Bernstein.
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
--can we use their names?--
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
The what to what?
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Thanks coach.
Like what?
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
Yep.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
No idea.
Charming.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
You can call me Oz.
You can call me Ostreicher.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
That's nice.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
I'm not playing.
I know, it sucks!
Yeah right.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
What?
You mean...and orgasm?
Of course.
I don't get it, that really works?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
But --
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Just in time.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
She's already on a plane back home.
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Dad, come in.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Highly, highly overrated.
I told you.
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Well...uh...
Uh...yeah...sorry.
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
No...I know the perfect time...
Yeah.  Are you sure?
I want to hear you say it.
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Ready for what?
What?!  How do I do that?
Qualify for what?
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Once, in church, dude.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
I don't care.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Fuck yeah we will.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Doing what?
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Yeah. Apparently.
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
Fuck me...
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
Well, they are French.
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
You'll never get the chance.
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
And you call me a moron...
What about me?
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
Andy? Andy is that you?
Sort of...
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Merde.
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Then come find me.
Well, I don't have any money . . .
I shant!
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
What happened to your parents?
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
Trying... to... breathe...
No!
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
I'll never let go!
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
How do you know?
He's her?
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
No. Empress, you --
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
M'mm.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Yes.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Me? Oh, downtown!
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Nice car.
Okay.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
think that's, uh-
No, so help me.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Yeah!
It's terrific.
Oh, all right.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah?
M'hm.
M'hm.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
U-huh.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
David? You call your teacher David?
Yeah?
M'm.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
Sinatra?
Whatta you mean? Me?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
Yeah.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Holy cow!
What thing?
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Oh-
Remember that day?
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
You're mad, aren't you?
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
The what?
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
My head is throbbing.
Oswald and ghosts.
You have a raccoon?
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
It's a narrow view.
Yeah, I love it there.
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
You're crazy!
Right, Max. California, Max.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
Yeah. Right.
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
SO?
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
We really had a good time.
You think so? Do you really?
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
Why didn't you come in?
You're fucking desperate.
I'm not that good.
October-ish.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
Of course.
To dander.  Otis.
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
Don't you miss it?
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Oh my God, the sitter.
Yeah.
He's not going tonight.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
And you're not the wife.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
When does he graduate high school?
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
I love you, Joe Therrian.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Lucy overdosed.
Monica.
We live next door.
You have?
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Fantastic.  Out here.
Did he promise?
Through the sweats or not?
We're great.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
I'll say as little as possible.
It's taken care of.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
Well he can't have gone far.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
That is not true.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
It's a novel.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
This is insanity.  Sally...
You don't have to.
Okay.
Me too.
Ah...
Oh, Sally Mae...
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Oh.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
Lemon.
I think he's really angry with me too.
How long have you been married?
Come here.
I like you.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
Trust him.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Not good.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
Don't go in, Ryan.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Yeah.
Very.
You don't know she's a bitch.
It could be worse.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
What does that mean?
No.  Not something new.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
I guess.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
What are they?
So how much do you hate her?
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
You weren't exactly horrified.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Wanna dance?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Yes.
How should <u>I know</u>?
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Well...no, but --
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
There's something going on, Z --
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
Yes...he's wonderful...
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Don't get all sappy about it!
Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
That's correct, sir!
No, sir!
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Oh, of course --
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You're a real buddy.
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Well, I have some paper towels --
Sheldrake?
Would you like to?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
So I see.
Oh.
I thought so.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Why?
Two o'clock.
You don't want me here --
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
In his apartment.
Miss.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
You did?
No, I don't.
The dishes?
That's very wise.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Seven --  -- queen.
Shut up and deal!
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
Gas?
I don't know.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Oh?  Oh!
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Relax, Baxter.
You too, sir.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
I got kicked in the head, too.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
What does he mean, accident?
Oh, I'm very grateful.
No!
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Just as long as she's okay.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Well, I have things to do --
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
No.
Good night.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
Important?
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
Stop that, Fran.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
All set for what?
Atlantic City?
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
Baxter?
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
Go where?
Yeah.
I said I like all of them.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
My men --
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
No.
Sort of.
Tracks ?
Fat. That's real fat.
Call me what, sir?
I don't believe you --
I don't know.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
God knows.
Not a thing.
Yeah, I know.
Shot himself. What for ?
I'll go with him --
Who knows what's up there?
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Signs?
What is it?
Which way? Right or left?
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Would he remember you ?
Ours.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
That's right, sir.
Haiphong.
No. Walked.
I met him.
Music?
It'll get here, soldier.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
Yeah.
You can't have water after morphine.
What Truth?
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
What?
Nah.
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
You're Australian?
Why didn't he shoot you?
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
Needs patching.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
175  CONTINUED:
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
I'll get you there all right.
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
28   CONTINUED:
She's dead.
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
It's exactly what you meant.
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
Wait a second.
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
A daughter in Oregon.
I'm right behind you.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
I'm here to do my job.
Too bad we're heading west.
Don't bet on it.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
They'll have to come right past us.
I want us to go out.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
I'm a waitress.
Since forever.
Yes.
His home number.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
I see the help -- judgement call.
His name?
How old are you?
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
You all set here?
What are you doing here?
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Note. Put it in the note.
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Are you still coming?
Nonsense!
Okay. Good-bye.
Were you asleep?
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Good night.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
I just love her.  How're you doing?
No. No. Get Carol.
Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
So am I, Frank.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
Do it.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Wait here.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
'Love was... '
Maybe this can wait.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Where are all your queer party friends?
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Get out.
Oh, my gosh.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Thanks.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
Absolutely not.
I forgot to lock the door.
What?  What's okay?
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
I know.  It was a joke.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Yeah.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Why?
Where you wanted to be?
The C.I.A.?
How old were you?
You were like a boy genius?
But you knew what they were training you for?
The exotic women.
Yes.
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
You said you didn't trust it.
Where is it?
What?
Yes.
No.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Thank you.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
I didn't notice them.
How do you know they're not?
No.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Why?
What?
What?
Yes.
Oh, God.  I see it!
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Electra --
Yes.  Please come in.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
Average.
Taken.
Anything.
That's correct.
American currency.
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
What did the beer cost?
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
We could make a run for it?
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
That makes you an expert I guess.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
Thought of everything haven't you.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
But how did the wall get here?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Have you ever stolen anything?
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
They'll never get us.
Am I late?
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
I fell in love.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
Holly!
She's cool.
What are you on about?
WE gotta think of something.
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
What are you talking about?
No!
Sure I'm sure!
No, by road?
No!
Regards to Her Majesty.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Ooh, well excuse me.
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
No way Doug, I can't.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Thanks.
I hope so!
But I love you!
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
It's not so much.
Yep, it's all yours.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
Good, great....Dobchay!
Ah, so what?
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
Well she sure isn't normal.
Am I invited?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Yeah seems okay.
No, just a coffee.
I had it coming from someone.
Guests.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
Not all of them!
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
A drill, what are you up to?
No problem, is it at your place?
Maybe it is!
Later.
Why?
Can we talk in your office?
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
We're not sure...
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
I'll tell her you were here.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
He wants to show now.
Yeah.
I didn't know either.
Demented.
It was.
Scamming's a strong word.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
Like me.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Kinda. Yeah.
It's private.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
In 76 years, me neither.
In ten words or less?
I'm really glad you think so.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
It means you can do anything.
What?
Why not?
I have to get you home by one.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
Twice a year.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
I'm not applying to college.
Pull over.
I should have told you sooner --
I will.
That I want you to take me home.
That's what I mean.
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Ever again.
No.
Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
How -- how long does she have?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
Yes. You?
She did. It was you.
I didn't say you did.
Thank you.
A similar triangle?
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
No....
Marty. What's for breakfast?
I don't know. National Cash Register?
But he didn't ask me.
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
I'm going to be at the dance.
Why?
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
Not a holocaust --
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Five cents, please.
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Home, school, here...
Yeah,  Right.
Ssshhhhh!
The power converter...
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
You did what?!?
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Perfect...
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
No way!
What's going on?
Yeah.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
They're okay.
Thanks.
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
What's your friend's name?
No.
Nah, I got me a job.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Sure.
Something mi trabajo.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Don't ask me.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
He was nervous.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
I don't know.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
How about over here?
Really?
It's mine all right.
Who're you?
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
Arachtoid.
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
The door's locked.
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
Don't shoot!
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Pretty terrible shot.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Which?  The one in my throat.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
You don't wanna know.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Hello.
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Drown all those rascals...
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
What else?
And what would that be, son?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I need help, Audrey.
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Who?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Can be. Not easy, but 
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Hell, I could tell you some stories
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
And I could tell you some stories 
Charlie. How are you.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine  you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
What do you mean?
No... no...
Yeah.
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy  like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay  that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing  although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Huh?
Yeah.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
No kidding, bright boy  we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Physician, heal thyself.
Only fry you once.
...Fred...
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul  well, all right, a little bit, for the critics  but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
Yeah.
Thanks.
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
Bring 1976 up.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
No.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
She said what you said she'd say.
Sometimes I really hate you.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
What?
Yes.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
It won't last.
No, thanks.
I don't know.  But you do.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
I'll risk it.
To see if I can get away with it.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
I'll meet you there.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
Why?
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
I don't know.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
What happens to them?
Somebody always does.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
Were there ever any suspects?
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
I'm going with you.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
Fuck you, too Nick.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
It was an accident.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Do you ever get sick of it?
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Annina Nosei.
No.
Aren't they?
Sure.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
Decipher?
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
So then what?
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
Hi Gina.
I guess you did.
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
It's Monday morning.
Staten Island would be ok.
Hi.
A present I picked up for you.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
George?
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
That's great.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Hi.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
Jean Michel Basquiat.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Yeah.
I didn't know.
I need this?
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
No, actually I feel worse.
I will relay the message.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
"Shreck's."  You --
Maybe you're right.
Have we?
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Nope, I told her everything.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
Weird, huh?
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
It does to me.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Yes?
Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
Oxbridge Academy?
I recognized the accent.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Hey, what's your problem?
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid to ask.
What exactly are you doing?
Damn?  Damn is not good.
Surf's up.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
She knows who we are.
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
Maybe he melted.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
She wants to kill you.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
You lie!
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
Adam and Evil.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
I've got to stop him.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
What?
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
Mystery.
Big house. How many rooms?
My life's an open book. You read?
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Wait. You can't go.
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
Nostrovia.
Banzai.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
I'm not-
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
I got family. ...Please.
A man with a death wish.
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
About what?
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Maybe we should just kiss.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
No one would miss me.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
I feel naked without it.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
WHAT??
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
What?  I improved her a little...
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
What were you thinking?
Oh, Bruce...
Great. How??
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
Uh ... yes ...
oh dear.
Great news.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Quite right, sir.
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Sure did.
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
No it wasn't!
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
And Boot-Head.
Me first! Me first!
Huh huh huh.
Heh heh. Thank God.
Yeah, really.
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
Heh hmm heh heh.
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Heh heh, thanks.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
That's better. Yes?
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
How's your arm?
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Wait.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
I didn't --
Just a hunch.
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
No.  What's wrong?
Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!
Our cemetery?
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Where'd they go?
Are you a spirit too?
I think so.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
Just <u>say</u> it.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!

I'm beeyoo-teeful.
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Why not?
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
... sheets.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
I thought I saw something.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
But not for long...
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
... But he's...?
I have no idea...
Yes. Thank you.
I like to watch. This is fine.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Our greenhouse.
So am I, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Yes. That could be true.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
I like to watch.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Yes. I like that name very much.
I agree.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
Oh, I see.
Yes. I would like to do that.
I like to watch.
I want to tell Eve.
Yes.
I can't write.
Yes.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
It's very sore.
... Good evening, Louise.
Is his back feeling better?
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
You're welcome.
Thank you.
I see...
No.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
But you won't sign, correct?
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
... Nothing.
... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
Do you need a secretary?
Yes, ma'am.
Hello, Sophie.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Look, Johanna...
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Right, Chief.
That could be possible...
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
It's that serious, huh?
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Tell your friends.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
Hmmm.
Hi.
What?
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Well smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
What?
No they're not.
You've always loved the animals.
What's that?
Me and John.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
The iguana?
I'm sorry for everything.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Simulates?
That... was... no... simulation.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
Schwartz.
Forget it.
Yes?
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
The usual, Barry.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
You're a fag or a liar.
No.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Hush, sweetheart.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Why are you being like this?
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Fork ah did?
Do you?
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Do we get to wear a crown?
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
No.
Let her go, Craig. I mean him."
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Whatever you're having.
Do you mind?
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
It's okay, my sweet.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
He's a selfish bastard.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
Not like He punished me.
Was a time I knew what was.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Baby, don't be like that.
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
I miss her.
Ya think?
In case of what?
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Mama?
Was over to Baby Suggs.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
You was friends.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
I don't want to know.
All he can. All he can.
Paul D.
Yeah. Look bad?
She was my best thing.
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Oh, man, don't say that..
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
The?  Who the fff--
Fuck you.
Come and get it.
We have the urn.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
I'm going home, Donny.
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
Where's your car, Dude?
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Nancy's pretty good.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
And was there anything of value in the car?
In the briefcase?
And what do you do, sir?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Yeah man.
Thank you.
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Now I got--
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
What do you do for fun?
But he's--
What?
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Huh?
What the fuck are you--
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Hey Walter--
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Huh?
What if it's during a game?
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Easy, Dude.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Huh?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Whose toe was it, Walter?
The nail polish, Walter.
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Dude--
Nihilists!  Jesus.
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Huh?
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
What's your point, Dude?
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
No Dude.
Dude, I'm sorry--
Right, Dude.
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Dude.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
I said out.  Now.
Stay away from me, mister!
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
This is a league game, Smokey!
Impressive.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
Someday.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
I'll heal.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
I don't think so.
I don't understand.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Blood...
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
He was here.  Watching us.
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Scud.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
Wait.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
You're wrong.
Watch me.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
But I just got here --
You're joking --
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
He will.
How can you tell?
Cancer.
Some. It's been slow --
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
For them. But for me --
Deacon brought me back.
Then what is it?
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
What?
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
The other elders will never let you get away with this!
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
Go on, I'll be fine!
We weren't sure we could trust you.
Habit, mostly, just like this.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
--my God, Nick???
Trying to find the energy.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
You sure?
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
You don't want it though.
--fine, later, fine.
--scared the living shit out of us.
What?
I can't.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
Why?
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
The, uh, blur there.
I can't.
I can't let you in.
--go!
--fuckin' A right--
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
Don't have one.
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
No one ever comes here.
--who?
What?
Fine.
<u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
Look over there.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
I think it's time to get out of here.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
--shit!!!
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
You planning on sleeping out there?
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
No. I don't think so.
And what's your excuse for being here?
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
....I don't know.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
That's why she kills children.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
She's off her fucking rocker--
--a <u>lot</u>.
Yeah.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
I am?
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Your husband.
I just gotta see a guy.
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
Thanks.
...Mm-hmm.
I said you're bad.
...What do you mean?
What the hell happened, Ray?
I don't know what you're talking about.
...What was that?
All right...
I think someone's watching.
Thanks.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
Lubbock?
Uh-huh.
No.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
I didn't say that.  Well?
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Got something to show me first?
Of course.
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Meurice...
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Tuesday.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
I've seen a few.
Okay honey.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Yes.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
It must be great.
The criminals are winning.
Yes.
. mommy's here.
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
I wanted to see you.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Yes.
What?
O.K.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Who's it, you mean.
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
Beeeee careful.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
I did. are you?
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
No.  Hi baby.
They hurt his head.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Here's to Ben.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Yes.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I don't know. he moved away.
I don't know.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Okay, okay. Bye.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
You better not, Jeffrey.
What is it?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
uh uh.
Be right down.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
... Stop it Mike.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
What?
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
Derek!
You'll see for yourself.
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
Excuse me?
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
I see.  How much?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
We want some grass.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Yeah.  She told me.
I heard.
I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
Okay.
Try the closet.
You fucked me, Diego.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Mom.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Tough spot.
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
Tuna.
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
Hello.
I like fire.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Kristina's fine.
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
You can call me Dad if you want.
Yeah.
California.
But I've got school.
It's alright, Dad.
Shhhh.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Yes, I do.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Who's the co-pilot?
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Who speaks Spanish?
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
Don't be such a pussy.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
Dien Bien Phu?
Sail.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Sure ...
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
I think it'll be a success ...
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
Of course I am.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
Right now.  Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
No -- never.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
I have.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
Rebecca Lawson.
Six years.
No -- never.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Yes.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
About a year and half ago.
I had a bad heart.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
She didn't.  She just left.
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
Thank you.  The State rests.
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
That's all Dr. Paley.
You called him?
No.
No.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
Yes -- he did.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Yes.
Yes.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
Why'd you come here?
You didn't know about it before that?
You know I can't talk about that.
Sorry.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Hi.  It's Frank.
It won't be that hard.
What would?
She's mistaken.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Tonight we open new doors.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
No -- you're not.
You're a monster.
That wasn't the deal.
Why?
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
You better.  Please answer the question.
Really?
We're supposed to go to the lake.
Some example you set.
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
Why didn't you come to me?
It was a place to start.
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
What time did you leave?
It didn't get there from me.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
Why are there two deeds here?
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
No treasure maps, huh?
Mom's orders.
Come here a minute.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
I'll get right on it.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Yeah.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
I don't mind waiting.
Want another cigarette?
Not at all.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
And clean.
Much.
She starts sniffing me.
We got engaged.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
What?
No. I'll do them later.
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
I told you, I love other people.
What made you ask such a question?
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
Yes! Hi.
No. I was just... No.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Oh, how is he?
Couple. Want to help?
Yes, that'd be nice.
No. I can't. Not yet.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Why?
Near the church.
No. I couldn't.
Trouble. Why?
I had a temper.
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
No one's asking you to!
But now that you have it -
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Hmm?
I don't remember!
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
Just some flies.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Climb out to where?
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
You moved into this block?
That place is already bad luck.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
You were just a kid.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Dad?
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
But --
It was just like in my head.
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
No thanks.
Should I?
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
I can't.  I can't.
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Why?  'Cause you know him?
There's no time.
It was him.  I'm positive.
What?
Just hurry.
Don't tell him --
Shut up!
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
Sure.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
You're doing everything yourself?
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
What do you want?
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Yes, it is.
I guess I wanted to.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
Mickey?
You think I'm lying?
Yeah.
He hung it up.
To let it dry.
Yeah.
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Trust me, Violet.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
I won't.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
I don't know what we're talking about.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...which one are you?...
...it's a problem...
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
We have to go home, Jason.
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
I don't know.
Right.
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
...I understand...
Really.
Did you?
Okay.
I hadn't heard.
Get the fuck away from my car.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
I want to go home.
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is --
Then I'll find another ride.
I don't know.
Listen to what you want.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
I can't believe I slept.
Looks familiar?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
I guess.
I don't remember any of this.
Thanks for the ride.
Go ahead.
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
No.
-- forget it --
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
You could do that?
What?
xxxxxx
Not really.
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
My husband's out looking for him.
Hang on...
I tried.
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
All of them?
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
Where am I?
No.
Uh - what? - I ...
Machines don't fix themselves.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
...sabotage!
... yer ducts.
Her name is Jill.
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
So how ...?
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
I do. Goodbye.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
Information Adjustments.
Them?
Oh, sorry.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
I didn't like it.
A heavy Christmas present.
Really.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Who will?
"And your children all gone."
Go away.
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Where are you going?
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
Information Retrieval.
What a BITCH!
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Here.
What's the matter?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
Sam Lowry.
Yes.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
What is it?
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Mistake?
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
No need, sir
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
No. Wait here.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
We are virgins.
Sleeping in the back.
Mary, we really have to go.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
I should be going. I just quit.
What did you say?
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
He's better, though, right?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
The ghosts--
Make a left here. I want to stop.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
What's wrong.
What's that, Frank?
It's coming.
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
How can that be? He was getting better.
Yes.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
I've taken that into consideration.
Who with?
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
What?
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
You're burned out.
Faster!
Relax, will you.
Used to be my partner.
No way!
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
You write this?
You've made my dreams silly.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
What's wrong with it?
No?
Oh, God, no!
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Why?
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Eleven and a half.
Good.
They're not that dumb, after all.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
You too.
Then it went well.
I lost six pounds...
This is important to me.
Speaking.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
Well -- my wife got this new job...
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
Okay, sweetie.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
Fill for a second.
That actually goes on...
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
What do you mean clean?
Okay.
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Uh-huh.
Not anymore!
What!
Is the manager cooperating?
Yeah it was all just an accident.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
Me too.
It wasn't easy.
Now you're a professional!
Carla...
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
You think I'm creative?
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Forget it.
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
I'm honored to know this man.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
What are you doing here so early?
Don't ask.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
I don't have another cat!
A parakeet?
Have a seat -
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Uh, sure.
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
You're like an undercover guy!
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Did you like it Mister Brock?
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Then let me give you something then...
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
Let's move out!
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
You think?  Split?
You look like shit, Benny.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
What's playing there?
Probably.  What movie is this?
Uum... around ten?
It's the news, Buffy.
Nothing.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
'Bye.
It could happen.
You guys are thrashed.
Not exactly.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
I'm going to the senior dance.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
I'm glad you came.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
I'm looking for you, actually.
In Virginia.
China.
Lothos.
This is it.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
I have cheerleading squad.
Our purposes.
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Your turn.
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Try to pay attention.
Fine.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
They don't even have Dolby.
That's the plan.
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Oh.
My parents have money...
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Got that.
I heard she got straight A's.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
You want some punch?
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
A little better.
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
No, no, it was great.
You can't seduce me.
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
I won't be needing these anymore.
He's a virgin.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
So...Wanta make love?
That's my job too.
I want to be had.
He won't make love to me anymore.
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
No.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
What's it say?
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Who's he play for?
Never heard of 'em.
You missed him!
It was a cocksucking call!
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You spit on me!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Beg me!
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
How?
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
You been in the Majors?
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
What?
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Jesus.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Then go.
C ' mon!
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
My right.
No.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
And where can I go?
Love to--
Pussy.
I ain't hitting a man first.
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
See ya at the yard, Meat.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
We'll pray anyway.
It's a league record.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
I can't believe you're doing this.
Was I at that dinner?
Yes, you were.
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Yeah.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
702 472 1862.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Help, Daddy!
I can't! I'm tied!
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
They payin'?
Listen...
Hey.
Ginger.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
No.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
All right.
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Yeah.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Why?
I -
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Sammy.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
Seven o'clock.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
Ace, listen to me.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
We can't get rid of him?
Certainly.  Senator.
Okay.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
Thanks a lot.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Uh-huh.
It's chinchilla.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Yeah.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
He needed some clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Mm-hm.
Fuck you!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
You're not takin' Amy.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
Who were you with?
What if he won't stop?
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
I'm not -
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
How many kids do you have?
Eight children!
That's amazing.
Mr Rothstein.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
A record of the arrests...
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
You can't talk to me like...
Hey.
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Here we go!
Nicky, I did -
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
I know.
I know.
Oh, come on.
I don't -
Mm-hm.
I did what you told me to.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
But I saw something...
What's the matter?
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Get lost?
I love you.
Promise?
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
'Go! Go! Go!'
Listen...
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
But he never talked.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
Let's get out of here.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Angelo and Buster.
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
How you doin'?
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
Mr. Chairman -
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
All right, all right. But I - I -
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
You're probably right.
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
We'll hunt him down together...
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
"Well done," Cactus.
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
You've seen me...
I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
Actually, yes.
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Uh-huh..
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
You could've killed us.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
Allow me.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
Then hang up!  Do it!
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Another minute.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
The one in Brentwood.
What do you mean?
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Lucky for them they didn't.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
You're all three of you in that van?
Put the man back on.
I can't do it.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
They put their hands all over me.
Hand me the phone.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
L.A.P.D.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
The money, Nels ... ?
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
You're the man with the gun.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Some loyalty.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Stay there.
Just relax.
I still don't see you.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
My pleasure --
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
The fuck I will!
There's two police cars now.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Take the 405 south.
How do you know?
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Let her tell you.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
Thanks.
How?
She's not a girl, Col --
Yeah?
Hi, Jimmy.
An excellent quality.
Who the fuck is he?
Charming.
Please, Dil --
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
He wants to know do I mean that.
In a way.
Scottish?
You can't leave me then, can you?
Like what?
Yes...
Maybe.
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
What do you think?
Didn't think I could.
I am.
Something I heard someone say once.
Dil --
I have to talk to her, Col --
Where?
What you doing here?
Must be.
You can always pretend.
Delirious.
He'd bring me carnations.
Okay.
You gonna tell me why?
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
Yes.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
Look on it like a honeymoon.
No! I'm going home...
Jimmy?
You knew my Jody?
No.
I like you, DIl
Yes.
Fergus.
It's my name, Dil --
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Will I see you again?
As the man said, it's in my nature.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
My pleasure.
I heard.
I know.
What do you mean?
Och, you do, Fergie.
You know what. Go.
And what if you don't?
I take pride in my work.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Who'd you think it was?
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Good. So what do you think?
Can't.
Can't we take it off?
No fucking way.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
Could you?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
You want to bet?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
And you know the funny thing?
What?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
Absolutely not.
Suppose you could say that.
You could have said no.
Shouldn't take it personally.
I'll bear that in mind.
Don't be so sure.
Having a pint in the Rock.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
What do you believe in?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
I don't know her.
Hurling --
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
Who gives a fuck.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
What about it?
Why do you think I brought you here?
You're going to look for him -- now?
Why?
Let's look anyway.
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Oh, I see.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
Barely, yes.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
Me? Why me?
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
Very good.
Next, please.
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
I said with the mouth shut.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
Alexander.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Which one are you?
Reggie -- listen to me --
There, you said it.
Oh.
I think I love you, Alex --
Maybe.
Alex --
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
No --
Shut the door!
How often do you go through this little ritual?
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
How much is it worth?
In money.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
Meaning what?
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
I'm very confused.
I don't know.
I wish you wouldn't.
Is that all? Can I go now?
And this?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
We won! We won!
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Charles is.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
I don't know where to go.
Don't you understand French?
The man and the woman are married --
Having a nervous breakdown.
How do you shave in there?
What?
That's all.
What are you talking about?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
The American Embassy.
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
No.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
So?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
Calm down Brent.
It won't happen again.
What's wrong?
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
She's still a virgin.
This will relax her.
She works at a church?
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
I can.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.

What are you doing here?
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
You eventually have to talk to him.
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
Does she fuck?
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
OK. increase the peace.
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Did Sharon say no?
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I do not.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
That's not why we broke up.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
This party is sick.
What?
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
The library. I'll be fine.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
What?
The word is Mob.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
The principal?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Just thinking about something.
And she didn't?
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
Ok.
What?
If sheep don't count.
...shit.
...that is going to explode...

Okay.

What do you think I'm doin'?!



They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo.

...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Oh, oh!

Three seconds.  One...

And it won't be pleasant.
So...where's my truck?
I did what I could for you...
We do need your truck.

INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Who's the investigating officer?
That's too bad.
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
What is it?
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Oh they don't?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Plus what I owe you?
I've been wanting to meet you.
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
How are you, Lou?
How'd you get past the guards?
Who?
Oh yes.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
Shut up.  Go on.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
I don't want to drop it.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Did he know?
Where you were when your husband died.
That your maiden name?
No. I'm just a snoop.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
What dam?
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
No, I think I'd remember.
Is that unusual?
Why?
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
It has to do with my father.
Give me an example.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
What about?
Aren't you coming back with me?
Sure.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
...so that's why you hate him...
He's in the dark room.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Ida Sessions.
Oh, good.
And Mulwray isn't?
Help yourself.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
I cut myself shaving.
Only when I breathe.
I never was.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Well, no.
Never.
Drowned, too.
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
But I have to know.
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
He was expecting you?
He owned it.
Yeah.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
They're all a bunch of phonies.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
I'm working for his daughter.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
Fifty lire...
Toto, come here.
Then why don't you change jobs?
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!!
It tastes wonderful!
Too bad!
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
That's right, Modern Times.
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
For what?
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
No...
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
So what's that got to do with it?
OK...
Where is he?
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
Go on!
I can't take shorthand.
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
You don't really think so?
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
That's a long story.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
That looks pretty nice.
Certainly not.

September the ninth?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
Yes, Mr. kane.
Has he said when he'll finish?
Of course.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
Thanks.
In the water.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
No.  But you're close.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
You really don't know who I am?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Well, I -
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
You're my wife, Susan, and -
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
I'm not sorry.
You can't stop me.
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
Thanks.
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
Do you know what that is?
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
Good.
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
I've got to think of Emily -
Why, Brad?
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
I know you will.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
What do you mean by that?
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
That must have been love.
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
He married you, didn't he?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Rosebud?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
How long have you been a smoker?
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
Can I join in?
He went home to change for the big date.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
Awww. That was so cute.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
And you said yes?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
So you're really getting married?
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
Sang.
So what are you saying?
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Like what?
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Nobody. It was closed.
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
I can pass!
Yes.
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
So I'm told.
Are you open?
Annoying Customer.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
Go open the sore.
What do you two fight about?
Oh yeah.
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
Wait.
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Each egg has to be perfect.
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Can you believe this?!
What?
You know what pisses me off the most?
I'm going to miss the game.
Sorry.
You've got a customer.
Can we not talk about this?
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
It's today.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
I'm going with you.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
An embarrassing way to die.
That's embarrassing?
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
I know I'm your hero.
I don't; you did.
I'm happy.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
I'm not.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
Why do I have this life?
Oh, like your life's any better?
Leave her out of this.
Leave me alone.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
Helluva day.
Excuse me?
How do you know that?
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
I should start.
Lasagne.
She's my girlfriend.
Actually, that's his night job.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Jesus... go ahead.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
I hate this fucking place.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
You're a pig.
Three including you.
He gets off on it.
Um. Thirty-seven.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
I don't want to go back with her...
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
You said you were here all day?
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
That's tight. Solid.
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
I hope it feels good.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
He didn't ask me to...
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Bye.
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
I admit, I can be bought.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
So, what do you see?
What usually eats a banana?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
You're getting warmer!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
I did what I thought was right.
My pleasure.
Give him the money.
Not on that leg.
Okay--I don't know about this.
That's it, you look like a professional.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Patience my love, patience.
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
We spent a night there one night...
Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
I don't expect you to understand.
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
Hal knows what he's doing.
I only came back for you.
How'd you get up here?
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
Excuse me?
You know me, I'm a night person.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Want me to lead?
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Up ahead.
Next time, date only basketball players.
Get it!
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
Never
That's exactly what I want you to do.
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
I won't do it.  No way.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
I burned it.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
It looks like a winding route.
There.  You blind?
Where's the rest of the team?
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
We can't and he knows it.
What about it?
Then go fetch.
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Try the wine!
Help me, sir?
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. He rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Alex.
Just a manner of speech, sir.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Well - I'm back.
Aye.
Oh, aye, aye.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Crabs?
Through there for a bath.
How're you feeling this morning?
We're going to friends now, sir.
Vitamins will it be then?
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
Good. I'm glad
Yes!!!
You're not cured yet, my boy.
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Sir.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Are you feeling better?
Four in this block, sir.
What?
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Bottega.
When was the last time you took one?
Max...
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
Of course.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
Pick me up in five minutes.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
What's he sayin'?
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
You're cool.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Okay, try it now.
Yes.
Who was he?
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Good luck.  You think they got families?
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
What?
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Jazz.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
It's not bullshit.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
In case <u>who</u> checks?
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
Who?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
You had to kill Heller?!
Some living.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
That's the reason?
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
Drop me off here!
Just drop me off.
Motive?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
I can't promise you anything.
I think you're different.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
Arf... You gotta help me.
Them who?
Yeah.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
I have no idea.
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Surprise me.
I've been reading up on it.
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
Is he dead?
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Right here in Manhattan.
Jerry, I --
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Thanks.
Come on.
Did you kill my father?
Where were you the day he died?
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
Where are you?
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
You've never seen her run.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Excuse me?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
Only on the football field.
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
I don't understand.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Where do you think Jerry is?
What do you suggest?
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
What?
Yes, sir.
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
Tell me.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
Thank you?
How soon will you be able to decode it?
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
Put it on speakers.
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
And a hundred mile airspace.
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
Because I can't.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
That's my scientist.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
A page-break signal.  A period.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
-- of Hadden Industries.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
That's what they all say.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
I'm -- I'm fine.
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
Can you try?
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Maybe you're creating a monster.
Why?
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
Something like that.
Really.
What'd you think?
The final countdown.
I can't hear this now --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
In other words.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
Recommendations?
Git movin', I said.
I'll make it a dollar.
I got two years.
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
I... I... I...
She's got him! You hear that?
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
You jes' watch us!
Drag's been chain-ganging so long he's got a nose like a bloodhound.
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
What happened? How far did you get?
Get away!
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
A Lucas Jackson.
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
You just said he could eat anything.
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
Forty-five.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Damn.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
How about you tryin' to make me?
What are you talking about?
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Only kidding!
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
But </u>alive</u>!
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
What Friday?
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
You come and visit.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
You're calling me a crank?
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Nothing.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
Then what do you need me for?
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
Well, thanks.
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
Go and look for a note.
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Classy madonna.
Let's get out of here...
Look at her legs.
Look at him, grandstanding...
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Right.
With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
You're damn right I do.
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
Or the F.B.I.?
Give me Ruben back...
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
Thank you.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
And her husband? What was he?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
One of your suitors?
I can drive.
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
Where are you?
I did this already.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
Please, Letty.
And the party?
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Do you think I should?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Oh, no, of course not.
That's thanks to all your help.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
When did you start smoking?
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
I've already made arrangements.
A deal's a deal.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
There's a spider in my room.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
I'm glad.
Letty.
No.
So are you engaged, or what?
Enough with the abracadabra.
The left one.
Good God.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
Break up?    They wish.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
No, I need some serious household advice.
Really?
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
The restaurant, too?
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Congratulations.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I mean tonight.
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
Sure. Of course.
I'm calling in sick.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Can you loan me a 20?
This has been really difficult, this whole thing.
I heard about your friend.
Sure, I understand.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
I'll float you.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You'll never get out of the city.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Oui.
Uh, yeah.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
No thank you.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
You want me to help you get out of the country?
No problem.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
Cops?
What about the money?
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Man, I can get anything.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Everything?
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
We've got to get out of here.
I'm not going to leave you.
What the hell is he talking about?
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
Me?
It's my idea.
No.
No!
The hell it is.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
How?
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
Cool.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
And you don't speak French?
Something like that.
The lucky ones.
No.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
I'll never live as a thief!
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
Really?
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Then you have no use for the sword.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
Perhaps.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
Who ever made that.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
Care for a hot dog?
I'm buying.
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
It's only a flesh wound.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
A remembrance.  A closure.
In a better place.  I hope.
Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
I don't know you...
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Go away.
Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
Fine with me.
I'm already alone.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Excuse me?
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
From who?
Forever.
It's not really important.
You talking to me?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
What? Another letter from your friend?
You implied it.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Why not?
Doing what?
I will.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
I do not.
No.
Not at all. Have a seat.
Why are you doing this?
Hi.
Yeah, me neither.
- none taken -
Any ideas who it could be?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Do you want to learn or not?
Okay.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
That's one way of looking at it.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I'm taking a shower.
I do.
You do?
What, nervous I'm going to win?
I told you to lock the door.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
You told her I never said I love you before?
I'll be in touch.
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
No.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Sounds intriguing.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Blow me.
What's your plan of attack?
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Yippy.
Take a look for yourself.
Where is she?
Where'd she go?
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
Get out!
And if I don't?
I think you have your answer.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Excuse me.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
We played backgammon?
I did?
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
You're a lucky guy.
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
I'd love to.
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
How?
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
At the old house with the voice.
On the back street  a green house
Do you know the people?
Irena.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
I forgot I had it on.
Well, it seemed to me --
I'm never unfair.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
Voices from an old dark house!
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
I don't know yet.
For as long as you'll let me.
A princess?
But we don't have any sea weed.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
Oh, thank you, Amy.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
Why hasn't he got a head?
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
Good night...Barbara...
Now, I don't know Amy --
Come away, Amy.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
Go on -- out with you.
And Amy mailed them?
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
I've changed a lot lately.
I've been working out.
At Victoria's Secret.
Good. Except for PMS.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
People notice you Frida.
Only to see.
Frida, grab that red one.
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
No. I don't think so.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
And my bra finally fits again.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
Give him the tampon test.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
No you don't, believe me.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Okay, I gotta go.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
You should have seen it erect.
No.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
Peter keeps asking me out.
So what do I do?
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
Frida? You okay?
Sure. See ya.
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
They say sex is great for cramps.
I didn't have to pee then.
Since when do you care?
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
This really isn't a good time.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
A man killed in Central Park.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
No, but thanks for the warning.
They do? Oh no...
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I don't think you'll hurt me.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
Thanks.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
You got a dog?
She's just so... pathetic.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
Take some allergy medicine.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
We can just take this pillowcase.
Why would you want to be a cop?
He's been running money for the Mafia.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
And you think I'm sick?
We only live a few blocks apart.
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
The other one?
He tried to kill me!
Loose ends?
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
What?
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
What is going on?
No...  No doctor...
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
That's what people keep telling me.
Yes.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Not that again...
No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
They're dead, John.
That's easy.  You...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
) Listen, you little...
Fine.
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
... What?
Like how?
Yes.
Is that everybody?
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
He's only doing what you told him to.
He was only doing his job.
It's fine.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
Choices?
Oh my gosh...
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
We vetoed that?
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
Fertility beads.
Certainly.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
What do you mean?
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
What?
Really?
We'd like to hire you.
I can't say.
Yeah.
No.
I had a feeling.
Well...
No thanks.  It's not that far.
I'm outta here.
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
I don't mind.
Oh... Okay.
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I know.  Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like Maria. I'll shoot him.
Quiet!
What is it if it ain't a curse?
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
Datura.
Maybe.
We got a boat.
What you wanna do?
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
Sir!
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
I don't think they're in school.
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
Hey, this is great.
Yep.
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
So much the better.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Doing fine, sir.
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
Sure.
I'm in.
It's Nuwanda.
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
Stop what?
Knox?!
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Meeks.
I didn't know you taught.
Courtyard?
A madman.
Don't stop!
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Nothing wrong with research.
Okay.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
I'm sorry, Neil.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
What is it?
I... I just don't want to come.
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
It's my birthday.
Oh.
what?
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Yes.
He's the owner...
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
And where is our point of arrival?
Did you clear this?
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
It ain't any better out there!
The thieves.
Then who are you?
A meat locker.
What?
Yeah...
No...
I don't take orders at all.
So?
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
I don't know...you got what we need?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Joey...
Like Mamooli's country...
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
Fuckin' A!
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
It is too! Now you passed it!
They did not!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
Yeah.
Well... you remember Cynthia?
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Yeah.
You are frightened, no?
I came to see Merle.
Where is he???
Yeah?
Oh, well...
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
Psst. Vince!
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
No?
Here.
Oh... You know...
Linda... Hey, Linda...
No.
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
I don't know.
Up north.
Playing.
Nick.
No. No, no.
Right here.
There's Vince!
Right.
Huh?
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Merle --
Hunt with Vince?
What do you think?
You're right... Okay, you're right.
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
See you Monday.
What?
It's not socks, Sal.
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
Naw.  Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I can smell it.
Your mother.
Put that on your political resume.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
We have to talk.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Doucet killed my partner.
Pass.
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
What else did he get?
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
How ya feeling?
Hospital food.
I'm signing off.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
Take a look at this.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
This little thing says I can't.
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
It hasn't opened yet?
And serve him right!
Why? It don't hurt.
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
All right, darling.
Howdy, Hank.
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
No, Stone!
No, you're not.
You are afraid!
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
The seventh day of April --
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
About what?
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Ten throws it is.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Shall we?
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
We can still use my butter money.
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Not all of it?
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Jabez --
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
Isn't that your own fault?
All right, Jabez ...
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
I won't forget.
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
I'll do my best, Mary.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
So, why didn't you come?
I'll find someplace.
What does he want?
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
Put it down now.
I'm going to count to three...
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
You don't want to know.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
What's it look like?  We're going in.
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
They're not after you, they're after me.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
Well, how'll I get home?
It's okay... it's okay...
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Yeah.  So how are you?
Well...
You're really crazy.
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
You don't have a choice?
Look... who's on the phone?
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
Do you still want the operation?
Well, then...
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
I can't talk to him.
What are you doin' in there?
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back.
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
Mulvaney...
Well, they go to guard school.
I don't fool around with you.
What now, Sonny?
I don't know.
Sure - we like you.
I'm sorry.
Why not?
Yeah?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
What about Howard?
Yeah.
No, that's all.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
Fuck him - let him out!
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
I want him to think that.
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
All right ... send them the guard.
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Everybody!  Back here!
They gotta stop sayin' that.
Okay, Sonny.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
You follow my car.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?

I said stop it.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
<i>Mum was terrified for me. She didn't approve of my lifestyle one bit.</i>
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
No. What's the big deal?
Do you know where Danang is?
She went up to her room.
Real fast.
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
Did you ask Sal?
Ask Sal.
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years.
Gotta go.
I'm coming.
What are you so worked up about?
He's just being nice.
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
Sorry, comb got caught.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Whew!
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
Fuck!  My money!
Look at that.
That's my name.
Talk to your son.
I got no say over people.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
Gotta go.
I work too, but I still make time.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Trust me.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
Tina, I'll be right back.
You're still late.
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
I understand.
I love you, Black.
He's nuts.
Sez who?
Forget it, Mookie.
I love you.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
We don't know nuthin' else.
Shaddup!  Jade, what can I fix you?
Tell Pino.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
I'll tell you why!
HARRY Dunne.
Come over around seven.
Ooh gross.
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Famous? I've never heard of it.
I know I am, Mom.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
She did not.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
And he invented fire.
Put some ice on it.
And my mouph is frozen.
Sucks for you.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
HARRY!
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
I don't know who we are anymore.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Roger that, Wilco.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
And with that complete loser
That's the one I wanted.
That's gross.
No.
Oh, you're good.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Special Needs class.
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Can you believe it?
What are you talking about?
Uh-oh. Harry?
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Will that be on the midterm?
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
But we don't drink from the house do we.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
And...?
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
Piter.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
Your Reverence.
Where are we do you think?
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
You feel the flesh crisping?
Where?
What can be done has been done.
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
No.  I never drink -- wine.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Huh?
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
Don't you bave a car?
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Do you want me to get it for you?
I am always on time.
That's good.  I could use the money.
I didn't feel well...
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Mmph?  Where am I?
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
Really?
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
I don't know.  Where?
What do you mean?
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
And who may you be?
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
We'll do our best.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
Ed, it was only one review.
So did you get his autograph?
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
This is my way of telling you --
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Raising money is tough.
Okey-dokey.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
So you're not a fruit?
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Um, I guess --
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
I did.  I established some tits and ass.
Maybe it needs special handling.
What do you mean?
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
The poor girl's out of a job.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
What's uncanny?
Yeah...?
Yes!
What octopus motor?
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
NOOOOO!!!
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Yeah. Ma...
Who?
Yeah, so... ?
Al!
Al!!
I'm moving out.
This is real, Bananahead!
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
What?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Yes?
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Right.
Oh my God!
He says --
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
And what did he come back now for?
Mom?
Ma...
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Welcome to work, Ed.
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
Right.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Well, when you put it that way.
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Really?
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
I know, I ...
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other...
So?
What did you do to your hair?
What?
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
Thumbsucker!
We're excited.
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
No. What happened?
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
What's the dif --
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
Please!
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
No. Am I supposed to?
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Oh, man! So...
Good?
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
pierdo.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
Thank you.
Yeah?
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Ethics are...
Sure
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
I'm looking at new cars.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
That sounds good.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Here?
Should we get a what?
Oh.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Still clear?
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
Larry, you just take it easy
For what?
Don't you fucking knock?
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
You fuck for money.
When they deserve it.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Of course... But how?
You've got it, Wendell.
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
What are you talking about?
What was that boyfriend's name?
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Yeah.  A great big one.
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
Let's just kill them.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine.
I'm not asking you.
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
Of course...
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
What little studio?
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
Man, what're you saying?
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
His blood's always up.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
I'll break them, sir.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
That's right.
What?
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
None.  Call it a hunch.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
Sid, how are they hanging?
What's he doing here, Sid?
What's wrong, Trash?
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Yes.
Nothing.
I'm telling you, I--
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Really?
What do they have to do with this?
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
We said a hundred.
What do you mean?
I called from a payphone!
How do you know so much?
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
They come after you?
It really is.  Did you find anything?
<u>Here</u>?!
Why?
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
What about newspapers and magazines?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
How fast can you learn?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
Well then who can?
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Are you sure about this?
With what?
Hello. Hello, Maria.
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
Can you help me?
Pardon?
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
No, sir.
No.
Listen to him.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
Robert--
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
Stacy--
Just reporters.
Stacy--
Yeah.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
Here, you can use this.
Don't count on it.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
You're not.
All right, look--
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
We're screwed.
You have to.
I <u>did</u> care how.
--otherwise we may have to--
Shut the fuck up.
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
Brill.
Mr. Dean--
Hi, dad.
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
What about jewelry?
The blender?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
Into what?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
You're tired.
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
I have a family.
No. No, it's okay.
Go fuck yourself.
Bobby--
How can I reach you?
The police?
He got hit by a bus.
I don't know.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
Yes sir.
What the hell does it mean?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
He's clever. He had help.
Dean's with Lyle.
What's your ETA?
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
As the wife of one of our party.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
I'd like you to have them.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
I believe you still have my book.
What?  No!
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
Would you let me pass?
Don't do this.
We've got to get you out of here.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
There you have me.
What?
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Her hands and feet were tied.
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
What's the matter with you?
Thank you.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
What?  How could he have?  When?
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
For?
Is there a song you don't know?
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
I see.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
What?
Are you crazy?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
K is for Katharine.
Why?  Is he staying?
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.

I've met you before.
Yes, for your hair.
You get Hardy.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Nya-nya-nya!
Of course.  When?
No.  He's - no.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
What if you couldn't find him?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops.
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
Through a window.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
You got a better idea?
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Uh. I'm showing off.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
So what?
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Give him the card.
Can you follow simple directions?
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Got it.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
Good morning.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Yes you did.
It's---beautiful.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
Thank you.
It's a party.
You're not on the beat.
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
There is no big job.
I'd taken the Mask?
My job, my rules.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
We're doing it tonight.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Like a woman of mystery.
They drive so recklessly there.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
It better be worth it for me.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
You damn well thought wrong.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
Thought you had to use some of these.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Yes it does.
Probably not.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Who?
What's your point?
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
No shit.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
No one's taking anything --
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
Uh-huh.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
You're not gonna be there.
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
You see your office?
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
Yesterday.
Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Right.
And ...?
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
I guess I did.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
In the conference --
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
I'm gonna go live with George.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Ten?
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
How?
Better safe than sorry.
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
I'm just saying --
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
What's that?
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
I will.  Bye.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
Yeah.  Who are you?
Yes?
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
And code the signal to my private chamber.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
The boy is our last hope.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
I can help them!
Growls a reserved greeting.
What's wrong with him?
Okay, okay.
We're not out of this yet.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Probably an asteroid field ....
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
How do I look?
Yes, you do.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
Where?
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
The entrance is collapsing!
No lightspeed?
Can you trust him?
Who's staring?
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
Repairs ...
Hyperdrive.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
You're part of the mining guild then?
I didn't say anything?
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Han's leaving?
You are reckless!
I thought I was in good shape.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
That is why you fail.
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
If it must be.  Yes.
No! .... Never ....
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
They look pretty docile.
He's a gorilla.
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Where?
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
Not anymore.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
Having second thoughts?
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
No.
Lock fuel rods.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
No way.
We'll see.
If he lets you get close enough.
Which way?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
You need help.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Thank God.
Give me the prototype.
Yeah.
I cannot--
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
I will not.
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
But not from your destiny.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Your mother told you that?
So be it.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
I will run.
People make you laugh?
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
You didn't ask!
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Fuck it.
Thank you your excellency.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
No, she was heavily sedated.
Not that I know of.
Please.
Of course. Have you got a pen?
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Fine thank you.
Why the math?
And those lies she's been telling?
You're kidding! Like what?
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Yes am.
Pretty close.
No I didn't know you had one.
That depends.
I beg your pardon?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Why, I don't understand?
But how?
Like what?
In Europe.
What?
Father?
You like it?
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Captain Howdy.
He's nice.
I don't know
You like him.
What?
But you like him.
Okay.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
So what's next?
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Sure.
What's playing.
I've seen it.
No.
I'm not Regan.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
In here. With us.
Intensely.
Bon Jour.
Uoy era ohw.
Oh really, when?
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
Don't listen.
What's this about?
I've seen him.
I've seen it.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Be silent!
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Take it now.
Suit yourself.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Accident?
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
Am I late?
Frank.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
Like an angel.
Huh?
Jack...
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
You got weird kids, Frank.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Thanks.
Only on odd days.
So do I.
Says who?
You'll see.
It's me.
What?
I don't know what you mean.
It wasn't like that.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
I'll drop the eighths.
It's not gonna hurt you.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
How about these?
You recognized me.
So what do you think?
Last?
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Right.
Okay.
Yeah.
Because I can hear it.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
She's a big girl.
Huh?
Celebrating.  Join me?
February?
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
Seventy-one
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
All right.
My watch is broken, too.
Impersonally.
You're an hour and a half late.
We ran long.
Miss --
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
That's the premise.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
Where's my name?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Uh... good.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Great.
They must've bought the same map we did.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
What?
Yes, well, they are.
I'll call you.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
The name's Baker --
Frank works hard.
He leads, I follow.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
Huh?
It's okay.  Last one.
In and out.
Nothing.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
How do you know?
Nervous?
Frank wasn't 'there.
Coffee?
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
We outgrew each other.
You don't pick your brother.
So how's the cat food business?
Huh?
I've given it up.
If I see him.
I didn't want to wake you.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Huh? Oh, no.
He's losing his teeth.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
My place.
How old is he?
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
It's important.
What more proof do you need?
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
What happened?
You can't blame me for trying.
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
What do you know about it?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
Gone?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
Oh, that Karl.
-- Studying.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Is that tonight?
I don't know.  Maybe...
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
Im sure you do...
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
I think I could figure it out.
Big Eds.
Thats where you work.
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
Yes...Jack Campbell...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
Damn, you are the real thing...
Everyone needs something.
Me?
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
Please.  Just tell me whats happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Need a nurse?
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Maybe youre not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
Uh huh...
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
What?
Yeah...fine.
Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
Uh huh...
That is the general idea, yes...
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
Really.
Thats why I work for Big Ed?
Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me.
Its good, right?
Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place...
Zeena...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
Think bigger.
A perk for what?
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Promise me again...
Jack.
Of course I did.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Yes!
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
And you can?  Power it up?
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Ben!  Ben!
Ben, are you there?
I can go hotter!
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
Last one down springs for room service.
Not this again --
Johnny.
I think that thing is Ben.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Showtime.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
Passion.
What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Are you kidding?
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
You <u>were</u>?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
Susan.  What are you doing?
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Medical's ready.
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
It's only for an hour --
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
I feel much better now...
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
At an operation?
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Sort of.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
We can get out through the Lab Section.
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
Look at those Walls up ahead!
What do you mean?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
Certainly.
I don't know. Few munce.
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
Whoa, Daddy.
We split that.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
What the heck d'ya mean?
Oh, geez.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
End a April.
Mr. Mohra?
Officer Olson.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Mm.
Uh-huh... A what?
Uh-huh.
And what about the other fella?
Yah, that can happen.
Uhn.
Uh-huh.
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
Yah!
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
You bet.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
...Babe the Blue Ox?
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
No, no, fax is -
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
It's okay, Scotty.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Whatcha watchin' there?
Yah.
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
Call 'em up.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Aw, Norm.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Well, how the heck are ya?
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
I'm sorry, Mike.
It's okay, Mike...
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
The day of our homicides.
Yah.
Still missing. We're looking.
Yah, ya think?
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Yah.
Yah.
It's terrific!
That's terrific.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
We're still men.
Look at my face.
Yeah, both of us.
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
Dynamite?
Practicing what?
I don't know -- am I?
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Marla?
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
You haven't been going to yours.
Like testicular cancer?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
It suits you.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Goodbye.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Please.
Good.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Chloe's dead.
It was the smart move on her part.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
What?
Who's this?
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Who do you think I am?
Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
Now, find your power animal.
No, supply oxygen?
There's always that.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
You get the idea.
What fight?
My dad.  No question.
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
Yes, I promise.
Uh... nah...
A liposuction clinic.
No, I'm not...
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
What should I have told you?
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
... is over.
Wait a minute...
I don't know!  Tell me!
What about Marla?
I'm not going...
Stop finishing...
If you know, I know.
Green?  Did you say green?
I think this is about where we came in.
It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Not exactly according to plan.
You need me.
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Please, God, no...
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
Signs?
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
How you doing in there, hero?
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
I have to save Eugene!
We need to hurry.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
No.  What's this about?
What was the fight about?
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Yeah, so what happened?
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
Clean up?  I don't...
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
How do you know?
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I know how it feels to be dead.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
Sure.
I...I don't know.
What feeling?
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
I know, we'll be there soon.
Who am I, David Blane?
Nice try, kiddo.
I'm... really sorry.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Thirty-nine.
Right. April 25th.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Let us out!
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
Design?
No one's that strong.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
Huh?
No.
Ninety.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
Read you.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
Exactly.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Yeah...
Powerful warrior.
Let me see.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
Not yet.
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
That's it.  My life.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
You threw him out?
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Okay.  ... I love you...
And who's Lydia?
He just needs some clothes?
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Uh... basement I think...
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
You can ask.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
Great place huh?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
They work for Him.
God... I'm the janitor of God.
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Funny -- you look married.
Parry!
Fifty dollars?
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
Well what am I gonna do with it?
You really want to help me?
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
So what? You going to help me?
Sure...
You advise us!
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
A wig?
Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
I hope they do.
Do you love me, Bobby?
Is what you?
What?
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
How do you know it's clean?
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
Who?
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
You know who it once belonged to?
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Very nice.
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
What?
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Uhm hmm.
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
What?
My turn.
Where's Catherine?!
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
What would I do with it? Run amok?
Then after that?
Tomorrow, then.
I gave it a second thought.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
I didn't have any.
At being a fake.
I don't think that's accurate...
That's right.
I'll be back later...
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Oh. You have to tell me that.
What?
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
You're all full of shit!
No, it's okay.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
I hope I didn't hear that.
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Hold onto this.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
So get the fuck outta here.
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
I just wanted to see you.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
I got punished, man.
C'mon.
She lives near Eddie?
Wha'?
She didn't say she had no man.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
So, then whadda ya want?
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
I ought to get some sleep.
Nineteen.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
They didn't do anything.
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
What'll it be Fletch?
We play tennis at the club.
That's Babar.
Well, which one?
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Breathe easy...
Just relax.
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
Like tonight.
You don't know me.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
Wait a second --
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
Oh, about ten days ago.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Course he has. That's his wife.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Where am I going?
They serve dinner on the flight?
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
You sure those doors will be open?
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Yeah.
How long have they been married?
No, thank you.
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
Hi.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
God...
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
He never sees them and I never met them.
Why did you do it?
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
Come here.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
I recommend it.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
What?  Who the hell are they?
Not really?
In a minute!
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Who's your decorator?
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Excuse me?
Oh... I have some questions.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Make eye contact when you say that.
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Contacts.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
How much?
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
People still watch that?
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
There's that question...
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
Did he just say what I think he said?
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
And hey, I appreciate it...
Who's my real father, man?
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
I'm off it!
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Let me go out like a man.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
No - no.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
It is waiting for you in the garage.
I wasn't looking.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Encore du sho ping!
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Fake it.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Where from?
Willie Mays.
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Morning.  Sometime.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
Give who a tail?
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
I can't.
Pour it in your ear.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
You know what I'm saying.
So what?
Nothing.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Don't know what's behind it.
Did he?
The future guy?
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
No.  This isn't what you think.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Wait...
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What'd you just say?
Uh huh...
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
Nothing...I just spilled something.
I don't know.
I'm thirty-five years old.
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
I lost you.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
Tell me.
She's not here.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
October 22, 1969.
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
You really wanna know?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
What...
Okay, okay...
Hang on.
What's wrong?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Yeah.  Sure.
I try to be.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
Sure.
Yes, man!
You go ahead...
Hello.  How are you?
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
Are you all right, Shelly?
It's deceiving.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Yes.
Maybe.
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
Damn you, Shelly!
Who's Horace?
Go out and plug the cord back in.
Why?
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Happy Friday the 13th.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
I found it outside.
Why?
But what I get scared again?
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
I've seen it.
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Okay, I'll call you later.
N...nothing.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
I'm now begging you.
Have a good night.
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
Never.
I mean really never.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
Nothing.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
Where is she?
Oh dear God...
She didn't push me into coming.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
We changed our minds.
But I didn't get you one...
What do you mean???
Please, hurry...
Where you're going, mister?
What did you find?
You are going where?
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
I don't want to hear about it.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
What was it like?
I say we go.
Don't wait Efor me.
That was a big mistake.
No, we're not.
It's your best play, Nicky.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
What are you talking about?
This could be it.
Our Peter?
We don't even like each other, do we?
They'll lose because they're my team.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
I'm not sure.
Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Yes.
Two-all after six.
That's always been my problem.
Joanne Bourne.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
She's my gynecologist.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
Life is good.
This could be it!
It's me. Nicky.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
They're only gonna lose.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
I want to believe.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Matthew.
Because God loves a winner.
Washed away.
This could be it!
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
You're out of bullets.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
What color?
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
Engaging.
A little drastic maybe?
Alla puttanesca.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Where are you going now?
Someone waiting for you?
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
He goes to the theater armed.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
Did they take your clothes?
I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
It was one incident.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
I hope not.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
It's for the best.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Now is your chance to find out.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Er, no...
A man's dead, Detective.
--What <i>about</i> his profile?
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
Luca could still be an accomplice.
Where did you get this?
Thank you, no.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
You had to be a right-hander.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
I'm sure I could have.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Michael's.
Not bad, Jerome.
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
I was at home.
Why would we do that?
Of course.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Those checks take forever.
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
New policy.
There's a problem, Lamar.
I'm not doing it.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
I bet.
I want to take a walk.
Whisky and a peach.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
You were asleep.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
That bad?
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
She's on TV.
And switched keys.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
El Paso.
When are you going to learn?
I think so... I don't know.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Yeah.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Pull over.
He took the day off.
I kinda doubt it.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
How long have you been married?
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
I know.
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
This is my brother's car.
Was the steering faulty?
I know.
What name?
Jack, you're wrong.
You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
I can't.
He was all right to me.
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
No.
While he was here. You went about together?
So where are we going, Princess?
Especially when I play the lead.
Yeah.
Nice of you to come.
No.
Did you work with him, Keith?
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
It never is.
My brother, Frank.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Don't ask me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
What's that supposed to mean?
How could I stay away?
What you doing around here then?
No, I didn't know that.
No. I'm visiting relatives.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
That's all right, Eric.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Can't say I do.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Sod off.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Yep.
Yes.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
You're bluffing, you bastard!
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
...they hold on to their money...
I...I don't know.
It's too...
You get a bad month, all of a...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
Nurses.
Yes.
With River Oaks?
That's right...
That's the truth...
No.
You...
They...
What?
No, we're just...
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Talking about it as a...
We are?
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
That's right.
Have I said that?
He would take you on.  Yes.
What?
I'm sorry?
Yes.
What if you don't get caught?
Why would I do it?
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
What do you care...?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
It's a waste of time.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
They stole the...
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
Yes.  The cops.  No.
You think so?
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I...
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
We had a robbery.
In school.
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
Just go to lunch.
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch?
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
Would you excuse us, please.
Levene!
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
You're done, come down, and let's...
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
Roma.
Moss.
It isn't me...
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
I can't split them.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
I...
Was it?
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
Last night, this morning.
Mmm.
Guess who?
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
What is it?
No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...
Yes.
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Go ahead.
No, his wife is.
Kenilworth.
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
Me.
Mm.
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
Mmmm...
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock.
My wife...
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
I'm not.
I told you.
You tell me again.
We're going to speak to her.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
I...
I don't have the power.  I said it.
Not to my knowledge, no...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
Some of them...
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
If you don't want it, give it back.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
We have no money for a rug.
Oh yes, the very best.
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
Because I need MONEY!
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
Not for strangers; for my country.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
It was hard to have him killed.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
...Who?
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
What?
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
How long does this go on?
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Yes.
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
Mike, at three and a half...
I don't know.
I know he's in Israel.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
Did my brother go back?
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Very well.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
Get out of my hotel.
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
Very impressive.
How is his health?
Yes.
I deny his every charge.
That is a complete falsehood.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
Keep them alive.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
It never crossed your mind?
You liked it too.
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
The Master is waiting for you.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
Well...no, not really --
No!
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
But I didn't do this!
We have his note.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
What did she mean by going flooey?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
Did anyone laugh?
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
I don't like to talk about that.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
I'm not, you know.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
What happened?
Do you miss it?
You first.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
You're talking through your hat now.
I didn't --
I'm game.  Sure.
I don't hear anything.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Run for what?
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Good.  Let's get dry.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
But you said --
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Fuck off!
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
I think I'll hang around.
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
Thank you.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
So what do I do?
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
Of course.  This afternoon.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
Righto.  Let me see.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
Six years ...
Tell me about Kip -
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Point-five ...
One more night --
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
Get out of here, then. Now.
Kip.
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
Something like that -
Your girl works in there ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
The other day....
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
Good.
It's all microchips and shit ...
Peugot convertible ...
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
Dignity...
There's no one left ...
one minute -- !
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
How's Kip?
What time of year?
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
I dunno ...
Yeah ...
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
Okay --
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
Hey, now -
I can handle it --
Me.
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
Price of doing business...
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
Now, we go -
Hospital.
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
That what you want?
No way ...
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
What about The Club ... ?
How is he -- ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Are you considering a comeback tour?
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
You sure I can't go with ya?
Not really -
Excuse me --
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
Billy, how are you?
No more shines, Billy.
What?
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
Wha?  Me?
Nods again.
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
Liar!
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
What are you gonna do?
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
That again.
It'll be okay.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
Just get me out.
You what?
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Jimmy.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
There are cops all over the place.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
How?
Will you stop.
He heard.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
I don't want them left back.
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
No, I had to talk him down.
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
You could put a pool in that backyard.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Retainer...
I have about seventy-three...
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
History.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
It's touching me.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Which one's your building?
Fuck do you want?
What're those?
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
I appreciate that.
Yes.
It's Saturday.
Find out what?
Pleasure to meet you.
Yeah, cured polio.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
I'll be okay.
I won't talk first.
I live right around the corner.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
Now wait a minute--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
Never been.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
Let's hit "Kelly's."
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Hold up.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
You think so?
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Nautilus?
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Time's up.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
I don't know.
Define that.
Yeah.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
You're not going to fail me are you?
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
You're Welcome, Will.
Okay, sounds good.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Pretty boring, I guess.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Do you keep in touch with them?
If you bring the caramels.
How the hell did you do that?
Fine.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
Goodbye.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Joe!
How 'bout you?
Don't hold me so tight.
We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
Fan-belt's shot.
Gallon or two?
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Joad.
Why, I guess so.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Why ain't they more like it?
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
That's our place.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
What you figger to do?
You're right!
I dunno. Payin' five now.
Women is always tar'd.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
I'll walk back.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
She'll be awright.
Sometimes they do.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Don't taste bad.
Ya say we're acrost?
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
They killed Casy first.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
I could hide you, Tommy.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
He was a good man.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
But who done it?
Are you crazy?
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Man bones?
Whatsa matter?
Now don't you go monk'ing--
I never--
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
It's what I do.
I'm Martin Blank.
Whatever I can get away with.
Really...? So what?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Then express yourself, Bob.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
I'm a professional killer.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Well, there's not much to tell.
Bad people.
Bad television.
What's that?
That'd be good.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
We haven't seen each other since high school.
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Yes.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
That's probably a good idea.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
I work alone.
You understand the psychology of the job.
Up on the right.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Hard to get good help these days.
Okay.
In Portugal, yes.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
No...
And they want me to make up for it.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
There's nothing to be done about it.
See you next week.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
It's a place where religious people--
Yeah...
You too.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
Work's good for the soul.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
You too.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Feel good?
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
I am comfortable.
What?!
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
What about him?
Whatever you want.
I don't care.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Little.
You already did.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
I'll take care of it.
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Tom?
My period.
If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
Okay.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
Why?!
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Let's not talk about that now.
May I have a suggestion?
Take your time.
Oh, I don't know...
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Oh, how sweet.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
You!
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
Yeah.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
She's an editor.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
Sure.
I want to watch.
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
You ever miss it?
Honey... I was always good.
Where did you learn all this stuff?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
What do you mean?
Yeah, cool.
It's cool!
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Again?  Yeah sure.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Dead?
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
Hmmm.
Revenge.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
What's this one eat?
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Okay. Let's go shopping.
We did it!
Think you can do better?
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Yeah?
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Are you challenging me?
Do my ears deceive me?
Okay. I'll copy it.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
I'm trying to help you.
You would have looked better.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
We caught 'em.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Congratulations.
Nonono, thank YOU!
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Don't get angry.
You don't owe me anything.
What does that mean?
No. You son of a bitch!
Get up there Rachel!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
About what?
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
Outside.
Got it Earl.
Do you love me Rachel?
Like a sister?
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
You bet.
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Yeah, hurry up.
Coming.
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
All right.
You knew. You just didn't care.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I don't know.
Its not over yet.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
This is 132, over.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Yes.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
Don't touch him Jamie!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Okay. Bye.
Of course.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
What's this big, big news?
Here, Lester.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Just answer the damn phone.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Are you sure?
Will you call me tomorrow?
Promise?
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Have a good time.
Sure.
See you.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
What is it, Laurie?
I'm scared...
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
Of course not.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Mm-mm!
Come in, come in.
Oh--
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
We're actresses.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
Uh-huh.
Could you--
You're out looking here?
Yes?
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Well, sure.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh.
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
What are you doing?!
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
It's on the table, Dad.
No, nothing.
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Because I have to!
No.
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test.
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
No.
How are you?
Really?
Oh...
I know...I know.
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
I think so.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
No, no, we decided!
Uh-oh.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Here.  Be careful with those.
Oh, yeah.
Singing?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
You know.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Well, I just came from an audition...
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
You're grateful, but you resent me.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
Yeah.  Me, too.
I recall you.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
Oh.  Oh.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Oh, well.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Yeah.
Take our literature...
They're offering...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
It's a growth business.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
...they did it for a lark.
Rich, comic book freaks.
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>...
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Impossible.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>?
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Have the child taken to bed.
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
I've never heard that he...
Exactly.
Try Barney Clark.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
....what...?
Shut up, Starling...
...what'm I looking at...?
That could be.
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
...yes, yes, yes...
...who say...?
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS!
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...and that is what you need to expand.
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
Or clear your windshield with it.
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
...no...
...no...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but...
...would you use a small word?
Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
I don't understand.
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
You have no idea. Now run away.
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
Say Hi for me.
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Wha-at?  What is it?
Nothing.
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
It's been known to happen.
Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week. My mom says it's okay that I stay overnight at your dorm...It'll be nice to see you in                          ] a different shirt.                                          ] ] WICHITA                                            ] Oh, I didn't tell you.

I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
Shoot.
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
Uh-huh.
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Never say never.
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Heather.
Don't talk to me like that.
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
Give me the clipboard.
Uh-huh.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
How very.
I don't know. Should you?
I don't really like your friends either.
Yeah, great.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
No-o!
You didn't say Simon Says.
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
What?
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
Punch it in!
May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
Get a job.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
Have a nice outing, you lot.

I'm not hungry.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Well, I guess I take after you then!

Open this door!
Love, you can still write to each other.
That's enough, Yvonne!
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
Thank you so much!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
This . . .
It's so beautiful!
You're such an incredible woman.
What??
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
You just made that up.
I understand, I think. Other women?
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Yeah, how's that?
What's the occasion?
How much time off?
Where's Allison?
How many zeros was your wife worth?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
In a word? Lucrative.
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
No please make yourself at home.
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
LaPlante!
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
It was you!  I thought I heard...
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
How recently?
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
Mister LaPlante...
Spanish kinda guys!
'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
Were you in it?  In the war?
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Yes.
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
What about a reward for coming forward?
Quit?  She wants to quit?
What?
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Dad!
Never reach out!
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Okay.
They're really white.
Whoa, check it out.
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Right.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
I understand that.
No, no, no, no.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
Sure.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Yeah, that was easy.
It's a living.
About us.
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Why are you mad at each other?
Uh huh.
Here, take this out to the table.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
That's okay, Mom.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
What?
I know someone else who's sensitive.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Fuck you, Philip.
Did you lock the garage door?
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Isn't it?
Grow up, Dreyer.
Do you have enough money?
The thermometer's broken.
And I can't help having a cold.
Can we keep him?
Get on the other side of that.
It's a double.
Promise.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Talk to me about what?
I'd like you to see this.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
So?
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
Central Park.
Around.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Who are you?
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
For what?
If it came down to it what would you do?
She's the King's cousin.
What worries you?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
No -- after you.
Can you really tell from doing that?
She's a treasure she is.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
I cannot explain.
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
Are you a cop?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
I'll be fine.
New York is dangerous place.
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
I've lived all over the world.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
I wanted to get to know you better.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
You?
It will end tonight.
How could they get by him?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
Me too.
I love you, Conner.
Yes.
I think he's dead!
Get to work.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
It was stolen.
What do you want to do?
I'll make the call.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
I'm not going to die for this!
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
Okay.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
I got the gasoline --
Keeps to himself, more like.
It won't be a problem.
Okey-doke.
Give me an ETA.
What do you mean?
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
Yeah.
You said they would be here!
Where is it?
That big asshole nailed my windows.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
I know.
What I want is to help my father.
Mars?  What are you doing?
Whatever.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
I know the one.
Order your men to stand down.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
Special Agent Jones.
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
Not until the man calls.
They've been in there all day.
I thought they locked you in your room.
Can you get into the office?
Yes, sir.
They're still in the house.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
You can let go.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
What do you mean by that?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Canadian Club?
You said you had no whiskey.
Get in.
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
No, sir.
I am always glad to see you Paul.
You have no whiskey?
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Oh my God!
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
When will they be here?
Give me the phone.
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
What cards?
One thousand francs.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
I will give you my house.
What?
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Where are you hurt, son?
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
It will do just fine.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
What are you saying, Tatsi?
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
So where is the lamb?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
What sort of plan?
What's wrong?
Thank you, sir.
I'm confused.
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
Oh dear.
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
Yeah...something.
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Ms. Marr!
Is she alright?
I don't know!!
-- what was he doing here?
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
And we get this money when?
I'm better than that.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
-- listen to the man --
It'll have to do.
We're safe?
Jesus!
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
You're hurting me.
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
-- it wasn't me.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
Why not?
He would have been back by now.
He must've unsealed the room!
Melissa...?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
What's the matter?
What was her name?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
I don't understand.
She talks to me.
Take me to her.
That's great, honey.
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
Good night daddy.
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
The place is pretty dusty.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Or what she was worth.
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
She's gone!
What are you talking about?
I'm ok.
Before.
It was a shame.
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
And what would you do?
Runic?
What?
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
Jesus Christ ...
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
So where is it?
What happened to him?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
What is it?
Did you know him?
Taken what?
I'll do it!
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
And he still sits there?
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
A prize?  For what?
Unh-unh.
Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Fuck you!
But how in God's name ...
Not quite.
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Anna, I think you better stay....
"But we'll be the same as we started...
Last rites, sister?
Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
God go with you, sister.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
Never, why do you ask?
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
Prison?
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
Alchemy.
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Why George, you big softie...
No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
The Hipster!
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
...I'm sorry.
You don't say.
Every year?
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Now, Aim --
Now, Aim --
Now, Aim --
Norville!
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
He grins wolfishly.
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Terrific.
I'm sure you do.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Yeah, but, buddy --
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
And Sid says you stole it!
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
Wait a minute!
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
No, sir.
But, sir!
Oh my God, sir!
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Ya get the special?
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
Thank you for waking me.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
That's nonsense, Alma.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
Yes.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
I like her already.
It'll wait.
It's my day off.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
You can't really believe that.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
I am not a frightened girl.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
And as usual no one believed me...
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
That shirt?
Stuffed and baking.
I'm not.
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
Fine.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Nah.
Jesus all right enough!
Yeah.
That's besides the point.
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
But what?
It was lovely!
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Yeah. You?
With Mikey?
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
Social work?
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Am I right or am I right?
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Major.
Let's see!
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Who said so?
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
Out.
Then why'd you come after me?
I don't know.
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Greetings, Charles.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
With who?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
I have to go to the bathroom.
What are you doing?
Communist Viet Cong.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
Actually...
We already did.
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
No.
Seven years.
You know what about.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
What are we thinking?
Habit.
Good to see you, too, Randy.
You don't know.
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Yes down at the station.
Yes.
Drop the gun, Walter.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Are you the leader of tis group?
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
Stop her Louis!
Is that supposed to frighten me?
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
He'll never let us go.
Yes.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
You are more beautiful than any of them.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
And no one knows but us...
So you felt it too!
You really believe that?
Then my luck would have changed.
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
I can't do it.
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
Yes...
The crucifix -
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
I don't know any hell -
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
You finish her - if you feel so much -
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Are you mad????
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
Yes.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
He did it to make you stay with him!
How could I not? She had to know.
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
Yes...
What the hell would you call this?
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
No.
What are you doing in my closet?
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Karla! You promised.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
They never found the body.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Can't what?
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
Wait, it's Nancy --
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
I'll talk real slow.
Rio, baby!
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
How's Julie?
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
How much?
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
Not anymore.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
The rest of us see bathrobes.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
What is up with that weirdo?
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently  walked blindly.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
No.  She shall not be left here.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
I think not.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
They shall not hurt you
What an odd question!
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now - I don't know 
Whet do you mean?
How do you know what my father thought - -
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you.
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
Her family name?
She's not too well.
Why -- no not before Thea came 
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
We still don't know that it's the plague 
You are my friend.
Listen to what I say --
Come - you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
All right  all right.
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
Well, wait and see.
Yes, but George . . .
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Uh-huh.
Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
No charge.
All in . . .
I'm all right.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Aw, forget it.
Hope you enjoy it.
No. No.
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Oh . . .
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
What's that?
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Right down here.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
This way.
They're not my children.
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Five hundred dollars.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
I don't like coconuts.
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Beautiful.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
I'm going to scream!
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
Tuesday.
Would you rather leave?
Please, let's not stop, George.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
George, darling! Where have you been?
What plates?
Huh?
Well, I don't know....
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
Swim for it!
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Yee-hah!
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
There's a shark....
Let's just go sailing, okay?
You bet.  Hang on....
The rope!  The rope!
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
It's still there!
Happy to do it.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
In here.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
Hey -- you can't do that.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Not till next year.
Hey, come on....
Sean's still out there.
All of us thank you, okay?
Too late, it's written.
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
You don't make enough.
After we've looked, we'll talk.
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Mrs. Silvera.
Careful.  What's wrong?
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Do you?
What'd I say?
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Going out.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Someone has to do something.
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
Shouldn't he be at home?
No.  Find your brother, okay?
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Help!  Help!
Next week.
Nope.
Double nope!
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
Until we find something.
What the hell is it?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
I'm not sure I can.
No.
Might as well.
Maybe.
No.
Quiet!  Shhh!
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Forget it, he won't listen.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Don't forget you have your brother.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Nothing.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Up.
Are you coming...?
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
No, you're not.
Sounds wonderful.
How's your patient?
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
... He ought to put him in here.
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
I want that shark, Kathryn.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Make this quick!
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
We're taking that shark alive!
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
She, Mister Hutton.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
He's missing.
Yeah, from Boston.
... Massachussettans aren't.
Depends on big brother.
Are you really?
Come on!  Check this out!
And alone.
Why you sonuvabitch...
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
The one that goes underwater?
He's diving!
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
I am serious.
Now what?
It's disappeared.
Calvin said it was all right.
Polar bears in Georgia???
All right, hit those lights too.
Got a job for me?
Who's grown up?
Something wrong?
Don't hurry back.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
He told me you both did....
Nowhere....
It sure is....
We need milk....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
No....
What's wrong?  What happened?
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
We'll be there....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
Thanks for the consultation....
Mother....
What?
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
You're not a pain in the ass....
You just got here....
I have to get this finished.
Why'd you come out here?
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
It could have been an accident....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
Won't you get in trouble...?
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
Yes you can....
You sure you know how to do this.
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
Still chasing fish?
She's a tough lady....
Oh, boy....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Forget it....
They put bombs on dolphins....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Stop busting my hump....
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
Gave them the day off....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
Lots of times....
What?
How long has he been here...?
I am...You must know something about him....
I didn't ask you to....
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
Screw you, Jake....
Mom....
I've got to get to her....
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
In a few minutes....
Oh, Jake...
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
Yes.
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Only me and Mom ..
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
You heard. Look for the knife.
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
How'd you do it, old man?
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
No, you didn't.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
To throw out of the window.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
You looked like you did?
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
I'm going up to the institute.
Bits.
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
I don't see that at all ..
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
Maybe he's lying to you?
Wrong cabinet.
Bullshit.
Why not? You heard my voice?
No, it has a mind of its own.
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
It was probably the wind.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
Do you pray?
Really? What did he say?
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
No I'm not.
I know about alcohol, John.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
The man from the F.B.I.
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
Even better.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
Ask him.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
I know about the bachelor party.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Ugh!
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Look, I don't want a --
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
-- stop --
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
Same to you.
Hello?
Well, I'm happy for you.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Hi.
Do you have something to drink?
Yeah, thanks.
Sure.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
You don't have to explain.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
What?
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
So this break... is a break-up.
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Call me tomorrow.
Very much.
You.
Fine.
Good deal, man.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Damn right.
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
You'll lose.
I'm not your brother!
Hi Ray.
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
One way to find out.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
What's a bad idea?
Oh, don't worry about that.
Nothing.
Eric...
I filmed this the morning they left.
Eric!
He's this way.
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
DAD!
He loves you too.
Sure.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Really?  What do you do there?
I try not to.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
But then you never get to go in space.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
You should.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
I have never been on this island!
But you never came across just one.
Back out! Move!
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
Everyone, keep your voices down!
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
You've broken its leg!
Isn't it obvious?
The velociraptors.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
I don't know.
Where's Kelly?
It'll hold!
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
Why did you come here?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
What?!
What?
I believe in him.
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
Can the kid walk?
The door security systems are shutting down.
How would we cut off the lysine?
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
Oh my God.
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
John....
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
Say again?
We're out of a job.
The fences are electrified, right?
No, no, no!
Alan!
What's that?
Okay.
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
Why not?
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Yeah.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
- - shut up.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
In a box under my seat.
Yeah.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
That's a good idea.
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
You got me.
Try to!
Machines hate you?
Kids get scared.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
What does he mean by "target audience"?
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Yes.
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Sure.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
Why did you do this?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
What?
_Krueger_...
Compared to this guy... amateur.
Who's chest?
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Insomnolesence...
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
That's open to debate.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
So what do we do?
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
And if he's not?
What is it really?
Yes -- that's us.
What was the matter with it?
I don't know what you could have read.
Did you?
-- In what sense?
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
Another one?
Then its authority is in doubt.
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
You're just doing your job.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
I know.
Why would you suppose so?
One of you must be mistaken.
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
Why were you given notice?
I -- I found your jailer.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
-- Listen to me --
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
Father ... Father!
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
Value? ... Value?
No!
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
Jack!...  Jack!
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
You think people hate you.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
I said yes, I see.
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
My name's John Klute.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
-- OK --
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
Well --
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Mm.
Thanks.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
How?
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
Mm.
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
About what?
They don't scare me any more.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
Goodbye, Pete.
Two years ago? Sorry.
She told me.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
Then how are you involved?
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
What else do you know?
Nobody's seen that.
Trask --
Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Wow!  French toast, really?
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
You got a letter from mom.
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
In a minute...
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
That's okay...
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
You mean for good?
Dad?
I love you...
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
Sure.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Like a principal?
I don't understand, daddy.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
No questions.
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
What about Billy?
What?
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
You've been living here, in the city?
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Such as?
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Joanna, what the hell is--
Beautiful.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Right.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Fine.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Ted?  Are you there?
No, but--
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
I'm sure.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Three.  And add some basil.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
What?
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
Cow.
And you have horses? You love horses.
Here. We'll collect them.
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
Soon.
All?
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
Far, far away.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
How many?
What do you think?
Roughly five thousand men.
It is an island. American territory.
Look here!
Ask whatever you will.
Britain?
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
What would you do, Holiness?
It is a difficult situation.
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Oh, yes.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
I need to see his habitat.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
You talk to Bickerman?
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
No.
Could we have intercourse?
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Who?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I'm sorry but you're...
That's probably good.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
It's okay.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Ssssh!
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
You wouldn't?
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
He heeds a tourniquet.
Likewise.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
I'll take it!
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
I thought I saw...
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
<u>Apologize</u>?
You like Jack?
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
He said he knew Karate!
What?
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
The somebody else part?
Else.
Well, except for the one girl.
Hot damn, Clarice.
I will... I promise.
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Starling -
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Jack Gordon.
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Who's the subject?
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
And what is that, sir?
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
But if he knew we have so little time -
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Maybe they'll catch up.
I didn't.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
How long did you live there?
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
Yes, Doctor. Please.
First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?
Early. Still dark.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Let us go, miss.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Why did they turn back?
...never doubt what you are doing.
Alice?
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
And by sea!
It can be dangerous...
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
Dark haired...
Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
What else?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
That's all, sir.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready!
Sir!
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
This interview's over! The militia stays!
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
He did.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
No.
Fuck your orders!
How do you know it was Williams?
What?
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
Has it helped?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
How much time does that give us?
I can't see them!
Where's Doc?!
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
...and a Russian grandmother...
It...almost got you.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
Who cares?
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
Like a leech.
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Probably no longer than four weeks.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
Apart from those shotguns.
It's a Samoan pub.
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
No Harry, you can't.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
About twenty minutes.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Furry muff, let's go.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
No.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
Out the back.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
What do you mean?
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
. . . What?
I'll only be a minute.
You will what?
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
Doesn't sound very good to me.
Seven hundred each.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
At what, exactly?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
That's going on optimism.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
Oh, come on, Amado--
I can't take any more school.
They're not going to jail.
They stole our land--
You think I can't learn that?
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
I-I can do the job, sir.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
That badge--
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
You're fired. You're outta the department.
You little pissant--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
No sir.
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
Dad--
My father.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
Maybe.
Yeah?
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
You could take it--
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Pleased to meet you.
If the next guy's a redneck.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
And people make their choice--
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
--Santiago.
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
We have a murder?
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Hey, Sam.
Buddy Deeds--
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
Steve?
The Sheriff.
Well, you hire illegals--
I was too busy.
Not if I can help it.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Enough with the clothes--
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Well, you were working there--
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Sure.
You sell much out here?
So when did Buddy leave?
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
No--
Another woman?
I know that.
You believe that?
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
Who is he?
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
I know him.  I saw him.
He's a priest?
It was me.
Why did you wait so long?
Yes.
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
You don't?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
You haven't seen anything yet.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
They won't tell you anything.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Why?  Because he had you?
Yes.  You do that.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
No.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
I... have... to.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
What about Swann's miracles?
Fuck you.
Mine.
Maybe I just bought it.
I don't think the dead much care.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
Yeah, I know.
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
Yeah.  You could say that.
Yes...
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
I don't know what else to do.
And he didn't have them?
Looks that way.
In my time, and nobody else's.
Yes?
I don't know.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
I got to go.  I'm late.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
A couple of weeks.
What?
Is he the Puritan?
Fuck you.
Binding you.
Why would I want to?
Not true.
No!
Bob, it's me.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Philosophy.
Ok.
I know, it's stupid.
I know. I don't either.
No, you smiled.
I know, I kind of blend in here.
Ok, whatever you want.
No, I was looking at you.
That's ok.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Oh, she'll love it.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
That's what you said the other night.
Hi, Bob.
Yes, no.
Yes?
Hello, darling.
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
What?
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
It's Lydia, your wife.
That's ok.
Bye.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Sure.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
I gotta go to work.
I don't know.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
It's nothing.
No, I wasn't, actually.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
You heard voices, you know you did.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
Yes.  We won, that's right.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
Kelson, hold on a second...
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
What's the...OH SHIT!
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
Maybe that's my problem.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
And what's that mean?
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
That's ridiculous.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
This time get your feet set.
Thanks.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
What?
To do what you love.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
She hates all freshmen.
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Just wanted to say good game.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Just one word of advice for next season.
Just not my type, I guess.
Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
Oh.
Kay.
Hey.
Figures.
What?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
Fine, Quincy.
Quit.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I wanted you to.
You're not stupid.
Not really.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Hey, what's up.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Cheap date.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
Uh huh.
What do you mean?
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Find.
What?
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
Yup.
Said he'd be home later.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
What?
I mean, it's not true, is it?
Your door was unlocked.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
I don't know.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
LAPD. Open the door.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
You don't have a boyfriend?
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
-- is not my boyfriend.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Can I tell you something?
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
What?
Yes.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
I want a shot of tequila too.
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
-- Richard.
It's ok, boy.
No Can Do.
What's up?
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
Well --
What?
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
Stay that way.
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Braces.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
You do?
No.
I'm trying.
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
-- memory?
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Like I said, yeah --
-- let's talk more about your background --
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
-- fuck you.
Around here.
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
Well I guess it doesn't.
Not a problem.
From '84 to '89.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
Is Linda here?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
I'm really sorry.
Oh yeah.
I don't think, he can't...
Calm down.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
And what about screaming?
I went out last night.
No.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
Then what?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
It'll take the pain away.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
Will that help?
I'll answer anything.
Well maybe.
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
...I don't know...
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Shut the fuck up.
What are you doing?
....it's alright....
...I don't....
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Shut up -- shut up --
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
I didn't know the answer --
I don't know.
It's ok.
It's ok.
....Why does he do it...?
I have money to give you.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
M'lady...?
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
I wish to discuss your brother.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
No, Louis!  No!
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
I have it all worked out.
Those can be adopted --
Three days??!!
But -- what is Porthos doing?
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
You're a fool!
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Everyone back.
Catacombs.  Very holy.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
Well... Well... Okay.
What use am I?
He is right, d'Artagnan.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
Raoul --
Athos, my friend!
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
I know.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
What is its antidote?
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
Whose rooms are those?
How did you --
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
It shall be done, your Majesty.
... You knew you had a double?
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
There.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
Raoul... is in love...
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
Don't worry -
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
I'll live...
And he took a swing at you?
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Who is it?
Yeah.
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
I killed them.
1490...Breckinridge...
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Hop in.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Then what did you do, play canasta?
Where is he?
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
Christ!
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Somebody hurt him?
No.
What do you want to do?
I know...
Why?
The mark? Yes.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
I'll pick you up in...
'Changes?'
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
There's no connection between the families.
Have him peel the top label back.
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
How far away's the back-up?
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
I have work to do at the plant.
I'm fine, Francis.
The Tooth...
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
I don't want to know.
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes.
You'll let me go now?
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Atlanta and Birmingham.
Why do you think I called?
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
I don't think I'll tell you.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Will...
What's that?
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Go on to the house...
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
We don't know that.
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
Huh?
I keep getting it for Christmas.
Yes. I'd considered it.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
George, I hate sitcoms.
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
Hi George!
What's up?
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
If you want...
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
Yes, your Holiness?
Are you sure?
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
No way.  Not possible.
What?
Should Tank I.D. it?
Oh, God.
I know.  It's her fault.
Two grand.
If you get caught using that --
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
No!
Really?
Goddamnit!
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
He's beginning to believe.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
Stand up and see for yourself.
Yes.
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
This can't be...
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
For what?
Your mind makes it real.
Yeah.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Yes, sir.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
How did you know...?
Who?
What?
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
... shit.
What?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
Are you worried?
What choice?
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
I believe I can bring him back.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Yeah?
I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
Not yet.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
What do they want?
You're not far from Cypher.
Thanks.
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
That means it's good.
Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Ok.  Wait here.
Be careful.
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
'And with your spirit.'
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
Not quite...but keep trying.
There won't be any this week.
Didn't show up.
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
Did you see them run!
That's not going to help.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
Mind your own business.
For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
Get him in.
Ok...that's it.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
No you weren't.
Ok.
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
What did he do?
What do they expect you to say?
Wha?
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
Sure...He lives there?
You're intolerable today.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Shut up.
You what?
Quiet please.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
Who?
Do they, m'dear?
That you've been to Susan?
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
I thought you were buying my company.
Right away.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Why yes, thank you.
Then why did you bring it up?
No no, not you.
That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
Like a marriage made in heaven?
I am now.
'Just kidding'?
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
I from dat nex' place.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
She knows you real self?
Sure.
What?
Are you?
But she loves you?
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
No.
I'm sorry.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
Watch me do what?
Be sorry for nothing.
I am, too.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Yes.  I'm tired.
I said get out.
It was everything.
And you can't tell me who you are.
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
-- Yes?
Thank you.
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
No.
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Not at all.
Good morning, Bill.
It is a deal?
You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
Yes?
Of course.
No.
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
Absolutely.
I wouldn't put it that way.
Then I can't help you.
Yeah.
Not at all.
I think you heard me, Bill.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Well, they're mine now.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Thank you.
Then don't.
I'm sorry, I --
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Watch it!
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Thank you, Quince.
Yes, I believe I do.
How did you know?
Does Drew tell you everything?
I am.  With you.
Uh oh --
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Raise away.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
I'm sorry.
Yes, but --
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
You and 'Honey'?
I'm sorry --
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
I think I know her.
From what?
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
As requested.
This isn't my room?
Then why is this my handwriting?
That's right I did, didn't I?
A cop?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Don't be too hard on yourself.
I forget.
Quiet!
Take the money and walk away!
You told me.
Yes.
Yes.
Sorry.
Yeah. You?
Yes.
There are things you know for sure.
What happened?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
Calls himself Dodd.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
Get rid of Dodd for me.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
About your whore of a wife?
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
Thank you.
Thanks.
Sweet.
What do you want?
How do you know about me?
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
You know it?
No! Should I?
Why?
Fucking hope not.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Are you sure?
It makes all the difference.					 *
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
Turn around.
He any good?
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
Two main players plus three.
Make it 35.
Okay.
Havana.
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Cost less.  That's the point.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Do I need it?
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
And what do I do with him?
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
Port-Au-Prince.
Five minutes...
Twenty on my man...
Okay.  What's up?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
Have faith.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
Yes.  What's up?
Bored.
What's it say?
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
For money for what?
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Don't need a comb.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
Who?
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
You bet I do, sir.
Gonna be like money from home.
Get down -- where?
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
...He had a bald skull and...
Where?
We go through the wall?
How's your hernia?
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
I'll pay extra
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Stupid.
But just...
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Something like that. Cigarette?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
Lucky girl.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
What did he do?
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
And?
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
Yeah.
After we're outside the kogus?
Yeah? Where?
What?
That's a great philosophy.
Work, work, work, that's all do
Mr. Yesil.
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
Weird shit...?
What?
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
I pull.
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
Across both tracks!!
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
I'll be late.
No, there's...
I heard how you talked to him.
No such thing, baby.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Toss the flare down!
How?!
The scent won't last...
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
That's it?
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
No shit.
What?
I know.  Help me get a sample.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
Following me?
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done.
Nothing.
Then the roads are open...
The phones are working?
My daughter must be going nuts.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I know how that can be.
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
I'm telling you, I can't.
The what?
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
Yeah, yeah...
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
A toast?
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
I'm glad you like it.
It will.
You don't know?
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
Just from his agent.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
So do I...
I'm sure you're right.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
No, the typing kind.
You're still a writer.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
All done, chief..
From her point of view or mine?
Sean, please..
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
What are you talking about?
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Right.
I hope there's a place to land.
And the check's in the mall.
How much longer before you can reach him?
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
Do what?
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Damn, you're beautiful.
Five, six-hundred thousand.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
Just about..
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
You were there.
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
Nyah still on the property?
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
Good idea.
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
We got it.  On your feet.
Roger that.
What happened to Jim?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Who is "they?"
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
You're sure about this?
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
This stuff is so sticky.
Yeah.  I follow you.
The arms dealer.
Profitable.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
I wouldn't dream of it.
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Let's move!
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
I didn't touch it.
Why?
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
He's our guy.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
Yeah.
Donít flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
Why you drinking so much?
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
Thank you, Rose.
I'm going to bed now.
Yes.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Ti amo.
Again?
You did this once it didn't work out.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
I didn't give you away the first time.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
Hurry up.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
Yes. Do you want...
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
Loretta.
I'm telling you your life!
No!
Where are you taking me?
What?
Oh no I didn't!
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Hi.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
I think that's it.
You're late!
Is Johnny here?
Johnny.
She was too young for him.
What?
This is a good suit.
Alright.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
I must ask for that back.
Pop don't like Johnny.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
That's a pretty big sin.
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
Will you join me for dinner?
What do you do?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Why do men chase women?
Sure.
Well. That explains it.
Is who down there?
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
You were a tiger last night.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Who are they?
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
Oh, please!
So be it!
Had enough ... ?
You'll what ... ?
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
Oh, just some friends!
I am an enchanter.
A G...g...g...
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
What?
What?
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Shut up!
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
... Well, we did do the nose.
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
What is your quest?
What is the capital of Assyria?
When's your next round?
I dunno, Must be a king.
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Is it?
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Listen, Alice ...
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Got it?
No ... just keep him in here.
No, not anyone else - just me.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Camelot ...
Back to your bed!  At once!
You got my note!
He's come to rescue me, father.
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Look.  I'm warning you.
Not down south you don't.
Seventy a year.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
I'm getting dressed.
You know nothing about her!
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Mr Brown, sir --
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Of course.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
It is quite late enough.
I need a man who knows where I am.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
Is that the Queen's request?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
Quite.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
See what?
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
To keep out the cold.
I heard something.
Yes, ma'am?
Yes?
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
Yes.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
No, she wasn't.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Yes.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
Cold is good!
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
We were expecting you to return by six.
Again?
Your Majesty --
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
Yeah, who isn't.
What's the question mark?
How do you do that?
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
How'd you know it was us?
It's the game, ARCADE.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Hey, kid.
Funny.
I'm in the middle of it...
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
No way.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
I don't know.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Put in a quarter.
Yes I am...
Right, then...
There...
I'm okay.
You have no time.  What is your question?
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
The game will guide you.
The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
There is no problem.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
How's that?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Well, I ...
I told ya.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
Right. See ya.
Yes.
Before what?
Yes, there was.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
I don't know who I am.
You don't remember anything else?
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
But I want to.
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
Why should I ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
We wait. This is an elevator.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
I'm listening.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Yes.
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
I don't help criminals.
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
When will that be ?
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
What do you mean sir ?
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
I was.
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Then what do you want ?
The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
I think I'll see hat action.
How can this happen ?
As appealing as that sounds...
Thank you.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Yahoo !!!!!
Wake up, we're in trouble.
Which one, this door is locked !
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
Shut up ! It's me.
Zach from work ?
Who was that guy anyway ?
Why don't you shut up now.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
Don't mention it.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Well you know what I mean.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Of course.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Have fun.
She just had a baby that's all.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
No.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
More than anything in the world.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
O.K. Thank you very much.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
Give it back Nicholas!
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
WHAT??
Change my name.
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Give it to me!
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
Leave me alone!!
This is a totally barbaric custom.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
Nick?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...

Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
You know how I feel about you.
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
Well maybe for you.
Sort of?
Is there milk in them already?
You have no idea.
O.K.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
All right, here.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
WHAT?
What?
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
No.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
What Hurts Vada?
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
What do you mean??
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
What's that?
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
It's nice.
Here?
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Any more soda left?
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Hi.
He was allergic to bees.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
I'm very nervous.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
Probably.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Yes it is.
Chocolate?
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
No, I'm divorced.
Can I use your bathroom first?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Yes!!
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
Liverpool?
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
I'm trying.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
It'll bleed.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What?
You're right, let's knock it down.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
But, I don't know how.
Umm, Ummmmm
Would you think of me?
I should look different.
Something like that.
I honestly wish I could...
The wandering sportswriter.
I have a suggestion...
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
You've been working on this, huh?
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
I wish.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
And what will he do?
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
I was gonna predict that.
Gold nose hair clippers.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
He won't get mad, huh?
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
... that this is all my fault?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
I know Ben.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
Well, somet...
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
Such as.
What's next?
Quite the little eccentric.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Boy, those were the days.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
If you like.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
Well.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
... maybe it's congratulations.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
It's over.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
And your point?
Oh, yeah.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
DON'T SPEAK!
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
It's two weeks.
That is so romantic.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
To him.
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
What is that sup...
What do you have to buy?
Hi! Star.
I won first prize.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
How did you come in here?
Green.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Okay. Thanks.
He knows better.
How is that?
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Who the hell is he?
What!
Okay.
D.C.
Sure thing.
To the bathroom.
What crook?
I'll just be in here.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
How in the world did he get shot?
I think we can do that. Come in.
She sure sings nice.
I'm not really a musician.
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Nash.
Sixty-three.
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Yes, it is --
It just is.
He's a member of our congregation.
I'm here.
Tom. You remember?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Older.
Well...
That's what you said before.
What?
Yea.
Money's no object.
What!
Sleeping.
Do you study at all?
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Who?
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
You serious?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
I see.
Yes you are.
Yes, you are.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
Susanville, Soledade.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
By all means.
Ain't love grand.
It's video.
Don't worry about it.
Aside from the obvious?
Do you miss Mallory?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Says who?
When have they ever been right?
No.
Got it.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
I do, too.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Survival of the fittest.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
They actually apologized.
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Wayne---
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
How so?
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Really?
Lose 'em.
And me.
You think so, Frankie?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Okay.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Like where?
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Have anything in mind?
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
That's right.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
You got a problem all right.
Take it easy.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
You almost got into trouble back there.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
'Been up north?
Just for the day?
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
I'll see you later.
Uh-huh. Why?
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
Huh?
I keep thinking about him.
You will.
What're you going to do?
Watch out!
Duff--
Take it easy, Frankie.
Like what?
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
'Got a good thing, man.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
'Don't sound so sure.
She'll do.
Sorry.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Sure.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I guess I ain't.
I guess not.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Oh yeah?
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
I understand.
I know.
That'll make the folks very happy.
Right here.
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
Since when?
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
How's the villa's security?
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
I'd say you were full of shit.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
You son of a bitch...
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
I don't have a girl.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
Can you walk?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Less than thirty minutes.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
How's the ice?
What?
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
So you're a wire junkie.
Too late?
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be okay.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Well, do you?
Oh I know.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Thanks.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
YOU KNIT?
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
What about the "Roaring Twenties" or "The 80's"?
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Yeah.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Jos, that's not what we're --
Anita, remember espadrilles?
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Very romantic.
Hidden camera.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Oh. Right.
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
He's my teacher!
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
But I'm not a penguin.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Is that true?
Yes, desperately.
I know.
Really?
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Thank you.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
To put us back together again when we fall.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Yeah, I have.
You were attracted to me?
Wait, I was going to tell you--
But now you don't have to--
What?
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
Who are you guys?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
Where?
Good.  I'm hungry.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
Who's Lisa?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
How come?
That's okay, I wanted to.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
Wow...
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Who?
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
I don't know - a sharp pain.
Oh, Jesse...
yeah, I had a bad night.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
I can't!
Huh?
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
He's full of shit.
Mom?
I had such an awful dream.
Don't hold your breath.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
To old friends.
Do you still...see each other?
Sure.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
Can't be good news coming from you.
Those are ancient history.
A little basic, but nice.
Thank you.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
Never been here before?
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
For what?
Try me.
I can do that.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
And what are they?
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
Mary Helena.
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Uh, fourteen.
This is stupid.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
Where...here?
Me too.
Now you're lying.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Well, they can be.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
No thanks.
No.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
And what happens next in the dream?
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
You abide by rules like that?
What did you say?
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
You've got to go.
Come in.
Oh no no -- no.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
My son's name is Johnny?
What do you think?
What?
You and every person in this country.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Hello.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
And what would you say...
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Nice surprise.
I haven't decided.
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
The movie star?
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Right.
Tony -- what do you think?
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
And we intend to use them!
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
This is Henry James film?
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
No, it doesn't.
That's not fair.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Point taken.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
No, 'fraid not.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Oh sure.  Of course.
Fabulous.
So?
What book?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
No! No! No!
Yes, ma'am.
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
No way.
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
B-B-Billy.
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
O-o-o-oh...
H-Hey, M-Mack.
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
M-M-M-Mack?
Are they all crazies?
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
They went that way.
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
Your buddy is callin' ya.
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
What for?
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
Okay, Harding, you're on.
That's nice. Send me a post card.
I refuse!
I don't trust you!
Just wait till you hear...
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
Hit me.
Me. Hit me!
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
He's not!
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
'Kay, Mac!
Because I quit breathing.
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
You're on!
What's going on?
How much ya wanna bet?
I don't believe it...
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
Sure...
Okay. Who else?
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
You's better believe it, brother!
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
He's in charge.
P.A. What the hell is that?
Big man!
Oh...
Why, sure, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
He's dead.
You ol' fucker!
Oh, yeah...
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
No.
No.
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
Dwayne?
But, Faith--
But Faith--
Hi there...
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Thanks.
Hm.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
If it's any of your business, yes.
He's safe.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
What?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Hi.
Well, good.  Good for you.
You too.
What?
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
I don't know if that's such a--
Hi.  Are you... busy?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
What?
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
Is he married?
So?...
I don't know, Kate.
I think he's having an affair.
But it's July.
You don't have a passport.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Maybe.
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
'Course he does.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
Because I'm the one who's single.
Hi.  Where've you been?
...and a fortune teller.
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Is Damon Bradley here?
My God... you're right.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Yup.
When you could've found one in America.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
He missed me.
Mania.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say  Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me it's the fault of the nuns!
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?
He was always a good kid. You know that.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
In a minute.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
I know. I know.
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
None of your business.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
I don't know.
I am?
How do you like it?
How about another one?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
Go ahead, wear it.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened I'm frightened.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
What are you going to do?
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you   Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies I'm on borried time.
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
Take it easy.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top ßoor the folks are usually out.
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
Yeah?
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss.
Forty-five bills.
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if
Thanks, Johnny... .
Aw, Johnny... .
You want to know somethin'?
You ratted on us, Terry.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Go on, beat it!
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
Keep Charley out of this.
What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
Where?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
It would seem so, Master
Ahh, she will be yours.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
Is there time?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
His assistant.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Why don't we talk about it later?
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
Her phone's probably tapped.
Shit.
Love is funny.
Forty-five minutes.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Yes, she did.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
Yeah, I did.
Whatta you wanna do?
I don't ski.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
You'll have to ask him.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
They're in 7D.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Why you think is today?
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Wait, I know him --okay?
There a problem, Foley?
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
Not until recently.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
If I could have a little more room.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Nothing.
You have to be kidding.
Really.
Shit...
Really.  He has a cop's face.
Because you're having too much fun.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
She did, huh.
Where?
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
I don't know...
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Must be a real soft pillow.
Any time.
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
How are you, Richard?
You gonna write me a check?
For a time.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
That time?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
I'm freezing my ass off.
Really?
Uh-huh.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
Me?
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
How you know that?
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
You not with probation, one of those?
Your dog was killed?
The State Theater?
Then they're not separated, are they?
I'd like that.
Huh.
I see that.
Off a tip?
Not at all.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
I didn't have time.
Well, I need that...
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
You mean hiding them?
That's me, Sir.
You liked that?
Sir, I --
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
You guys are new?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
What facts are those?
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Boxin'.
You too, Lieutenant.
We're all going away.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
Have the planes made it to China?
God help them.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Crank her!
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
Peggy Sue!
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Peggy Sue!
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
I can't. It's all too much.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
On what?
That loudmouthed little bitch~
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
That's disgusting!
Don't say that...
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
I call this the staccato.
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
What am I going to do with you?
I just can't trust you anymore.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Right here. Now sit down.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
What about Janet?
Oh, God, Dion.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
It must run in the family.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
What?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
How do you feel?
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
For what?
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
What does Charlie think about that?
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
You have an incredible memory.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
What was?
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
What's inside?
How, did you know about my grandfather?
I don't know.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
Wbat're you talking about?
Sixtyforty.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Well... uh... thanks...
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
I suppose so.
How'd you know that?
Yes... why?
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
You alright?
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
You never get over it.
Yeah...
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Sorry...
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
I said, don't worry about it.
A reaction to AZT...
You're going to the office?!
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
Close the law book.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
Ready for what, baby?
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
Honesty is always best.
Don't do this, Andy.
He's upset, he's sorry.
Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
Funny.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
Little baby girl.
Continue.
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
What's her name?
Rayisha. Very nice.
They didn't fire her?
Thank you.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Do you... pray?
What happens?
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
What kind of person is that?
I suppose you could say that.
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
Yes. On my torso.
Yes.
Yes.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
Absolutely.
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Answer the question, please.
Objection.
Yes.
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Right.
We were satisfied.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Give me the camera, Joe.
Duh...
Okay, Joe...
Fine, Joe.
That's perfectly clear.
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
You had one guy "like that?"
Dr. J.!
Charles...
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
Show me your eyes.
Look deeper.
They're coming.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Saw something I didn't like.
Get out of our way.
Let's drop back an' boot up.
We can't make it.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
I can't....I can't....
Don't do this to me....
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
Possibly.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
Shut up.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
60 years ago.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
I never said I was.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
What the hell's it matter?
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
What, you're goin' off, too?
Riddick?
Has anyone checked the coring room?
There is no "safe."
Which half?
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Not staying in here another....
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
No. She's not.
Not if I'm the one.
What do you care?
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
You still don't believe me, do you?
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Good luck then.
No.
What's so special about him?
Remembers what?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Sustained.
Huh?
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
What signal?
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Climb off me, will you!
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
I think you're making a mistake.
He wouldn't leave her.
Why special?
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Mind your tongue, madame.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Yes.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Taylor, you can't.
Why not?
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
God bless you.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
Says he can't walk.
Fuck you bitch.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Youse so fucked up man.
What?
Where's Elias come from?
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Yeah.
Nah...
Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
What are the heads?
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
I don't know.

I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
How do you do?
Possibly, Miss.
Bank?
I see.
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
Much too late.
That's all there is.
There wasn't any plane.
Just who are you, anyway?
Absolutely sure.
Nothing matters.
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
You leave it.
That, and the fun of it.
That's right.
So that I will never be found.
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Magruder does.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Do you think I was faking?
Ale. I don't mind.
We wouldn't have met at all.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
Is it a crime?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
We know everything.
Who's Goble?
I'm not interested in blind dates.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
For two hundred?
Sometimes.
Leave that one lay.
What's a buzzer?
I don't.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
I never notice the view after the first week.
Could we discuss that some other time?
A couple of hours.
That must hurt.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
What?
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
Go live in a tent.
You get it's brother.
So?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
Not if it clears the air.
That leaves two strangers.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
What are my orders, sir?
Who's the girl?
Nice.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
How about your new friend?
What a shame.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Yes.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
Exactly that.
Of course.
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
...break away completely from--
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
No.  I'd want to--
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
Both dead.
I think she liked me.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
Why not.
We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
Mmm...
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm not sure.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
You're a piece of shit
All right.
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Voila!
You'd look naked without one.
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
No.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
You do it... you first!
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
But you're not alone.
SHIT!!
I'm not FBI anymore.
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Sir?
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Caught my first tube this morning.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Okay, Dad.
This Zen master surfer.
Yeah, or cashing a check.
I need you to teach me.
What are you talking about?
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
What?
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
Who's our back-up on this?
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
You know you can't win this one.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
It's been a long time, General.
What's that, General?
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
He knows our defenses.
Please, we hardly know each other.
No.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
You're making the right decision, sir.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
What motel you staying at?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
I never joke about money.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Diet coke.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Oooh, thank god.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
What?
Done.
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
I have work to do.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
Shall we mingle?
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Vivian...
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
I'll guard them and you with my life.
Huh?
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
I more than liked it.
It was a business decision.
It was good.
Vivian...
Thank you.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
I'm here.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Goodbye, Bill.
Why?
Give me twenty minutes.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Kit!  Where've you been?
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Go for the bucks.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
I leave extras, miss.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Miss Vivian.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Do you remember me?
I just might do that.
So it's to be torture.
You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
Of course.
I do not marry tonight.
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
And what am I?
As you wish.
Well ... you were dead.
I will never doubt again.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
Gently!!
Did you say, "I do"?
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
You never said anything about killing anyone.
Veer left. Left. Left!
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
What do I do?
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
How many could you handle?
What?
Yeah. It's really good.
I don't be-leeve this.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Because I can stop now if you want.
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
DEATH FIRST!!
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
He's already dead.
Are you a rotten liar.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
Again. Thank you.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
You're sure nobody's following us?
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
Have fun storming the castle.
A little bit.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady.
Where?  What?
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Right.
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
You found a flop!
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
Really, I never dreamed ...
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
The Graf Spee...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
I mean in show business.
What do you do best?
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Send for Goebbels.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
Back where?
And when she left, she never came back.
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Someone is sitting in that window.
If she paid you well?
Must've needed it.
Sam, if she's here...
Can I trade in my car and take another?
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
Five hundred.
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Lila.
I want to know if my sister is here.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
Yes.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Where's the old highway?
An hour! Or less!
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Sam.
Who's he?
Well?
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
Of course we will.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
Hospital clean.
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
No.
Los Angeles.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
I'd like to.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
You'd know, of course.
Uncommon, too.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
He's already been.
At this hour?
Arbogast.
I don't know what you've been saying.
Do what?
Leave me alone!
Did I?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Indeed, he has often told me.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Well, news of Buckley?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
Yes, the child ...
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
You would.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti!
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Horsefeathers!
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Cry-baby?
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
You go in for dangerous things.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
Yes....
Where to?
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
Well, some fiend might.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
Good night, Rose.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Yeah.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Well, a little.
Well, it's not very plain.
Well... maybe...
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
Yeah.
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
Here comes Daddy.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Yes, of course.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Got yourself up?
There are more on the other side.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Yes, sir.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
You mean a farm?
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
Illusions, Madam?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
I don't mind.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
What and?  That's what I got.
Fair enough.
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
I don't know.  Fuck off!
What... ?
I need the "when" and the "where."
That wasn't my fault.
What do you want me to do about it?
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Yeah.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
Feeling great.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
It's go time, Billy-B.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
No.
There probably is.
Where have you been?
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
I... I think I can... clarify...
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
You know... you could say thank you.
Absolutely.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
You think this is so easy?
Oh yeah?
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
I know it is, even if you don't.
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Gimmie a minute.
Your wish is my command.
Seatbelts fastened, please.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Keep 'em busy.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
Yoda will always be with you.
I can't see.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
It'll work. It'll work.
Ahhh...
Hold me.
Good, I hate long waits.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Red Leader standing by.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
Oh, no.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
There is no conflict.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
Rocky!
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
I've got something to say.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
We must have a blow-out.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Weiss.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Makes you cry
Makes you cry
Free to try and find a game
Oh no no no no.
No no no no.
Ohh!
I don't think you're a bum.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
I think he might be worried.
I don't think I belong here.
What?
I'll be waiting.
Sharp -- Real nice.
-- The legs.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
...What?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Why?
Paulie!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
...Stop jivin'!
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
Very high an' very fast.
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Move your shoulders down.
Why?
No dollar.
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
Charge it.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Bob.
That's it, I'm broke.
You have my food in ya hand.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
What'd you say?
Hey --
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
I won't.
...Tomato?
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Yeah --
...No.
Message -- What message?
Freak luck for sure.
Freak luck is a strange thing.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
I never had good footwork.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
What?
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
Shoulda guessed.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
Surprised?
Toons aren't given imperfections.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
Eddie, come on.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
What a gasser.
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Yeah?
From this box here...
I do bite my thumb, sir!
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Why, what is Tybalt?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
Young Romeo is it?
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Well, what was yours?
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Right.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
Do you really think so?
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
That's why you were riding with him.
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
You were a soldier, were you?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Is that right?
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Ready when you are...
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
I think not.  After you...
There's been a slight problem.
Enough!
You'll die if you leave here.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
A post office box.
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Not exactly.
I didn't expect that he would.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
Is that right?
What a surprise...
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
You should learn a little patience.
Like Larry or Swede.
So is the woman.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
I just wanted to see something.
A lot of people died.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
It's my job.
Dark ops?
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
I don't know...
Do you have a good answer?
What?
What of it?
Gone.  Destroyed.
Gonna be tough.
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
I can't get enough of it.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
At the expense of six people.
What's that?
I...I can't do that.
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
No.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
You killed him...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Why don't you get to the point.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
Two thousand...
Shut up, Jesse.
Hello.
What for?
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
Great...
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
Could it have been this?
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
Did you say After Midnight?
Anything...specific?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Sure.
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Yeah whaddya want?.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
I don't know...
Yeah let's hear about your day.
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Right behind you.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Hi.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
Absolutely positively.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
No, sir.
How much is that?
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
I don't think so.
This is your ship?
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
I don't think so...
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
I am a tourist.
I'm calling for back up!
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Excuse me?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
She never even looked at you.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
Shhh, my head hurts.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
What?!?!
It's worth it to me.
Yes.
Fine with me.
How do I know I can trust you?
I'm fine.
The Secret Service?  Why?
I'll take him.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Ricky Tan?
This is still Hong Kong.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
OK. Say what it is.
Tell me about it.
So was I.
Witnesses.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Don't go there...
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Stool pigeon.
Come on!
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Yeah, it's good.
Yee-aww.
I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
No, fish is a PM food.
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
Oh yes.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
You have what I asked for?
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
Thank you.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
God bless you, Maggie.
"Never say die."
What?
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
No, she's talking about your hair.
Originality is my speciality.
A pre-wedding luau?
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
You don't know.
Of course.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
Can you fix it?
Of what?
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
You humiliated me!
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
I love you, too.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
It's something I've always wanted to do.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
-- who's married to --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
They're going to love you.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Happy New Year.
Walter, I'd love to --
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
So what happened?
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
No.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
Good night.
He said hello.
No, I'm not.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
A sense of humor.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
We'll move them --
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Magic.
Mom!
Sure you do --
Hello.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
What's she talking about?
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling.
She died.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
I don't get it.
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Window.
It's a spice rack.
It's never happening again. Right?
My feelings exactly.
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
-- a slice of pizza --
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Good.
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
There she is.
She's going to cook something for us?
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
Shut up.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
I don't make policy.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
They are singing for me.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
I did forget. Luís told me.
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
He'll have it good. Some day.
What makes you so sure?
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
I'm going back tomorrow.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
Be still ...
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
But honey ...
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
The what!
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
Shhh.
The spiders.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ...
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
This man sounds like a real catch.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
You get off on abuse or something?
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
How?
Nothing.
You can still work.
Find a new job.
They would have killed you too.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
I know a guy.
Can you set that up?
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
I think on account of his nose.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Yes, Jimmy
Wait till I tell you what it is.
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
Crank or glass?
No, I'm good.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Yeah.
Just some buddies.
You go, boy.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
It's not my place.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
Tell me what?
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
When?
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Jesus.
My name is Tom.
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Who the hell is Jimmy?
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
I thought you were done.
...alright, let me know when.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
Spit it out, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
You must be a hell a shot.
Shit, that was no big deal.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Shut up, will you?
Of course, sir.
What deal?
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Say what, Cap'n?
A half-track, anything.
It was nothing.
Pass.
You know classical music?
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
I don't expect to live that long.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
What about Talbot?
Nope.
Three for three.
You're kidding yourself.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
I know.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Yes, sir.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
But, sir...
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
You have orders, too.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
I don't like that one.
But we accomplish the mission.
What if our guys open up, sir?
Here they come.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Alright, come with me.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Lingerie.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Twenty-four-five.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
He's a mess!
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
See you tomorrow.
Read it.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
You're going.
But I found the money.
Yes, I...
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Alright.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Hi.  You called me?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
No.
Bye.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
That's cool then.
Basic.  Hmmm.
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay.
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
I'm doing alright.
Oh.  I was putting the...
This is so noble.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
Your letter came yesterday.
It was wonderful.
No, we don't have to say it.
No I didn't.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I love you.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Uh... okay... um...
No.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
How do you pay for one of those?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
I know this part, keep reading.
Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.
What?
Alright!
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
War.
It's a beautiful city.
You're kidding.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
What's going on?
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
Look -
Yeah, I can.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
She's good.
Things are great, things are great.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Pistols?
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Something they can hold in their hands.
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Yes.
No?
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
What is it?
What? I can't hear you...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Why aren't you there?
I live here.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
You have a right to be angry.
Why don't you ask them?
No, I don't.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
Finish what my son started.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
Yeah.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
It's under control.
Youre not going to get away with this.
What guy?
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
What are we looking for?
Can we turn the light on?
No, wait here.
But who would operate your camera?
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Her old boyfriend?
Easy black boy.
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
You're not allowed to ask that.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
..harmonica style is okay.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
We got free tickets.
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
I get scared really easy, okay.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
I don't know.
More of a game really.
To see your reaction.
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
Someone stole Sid's file?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
What?
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Who is it?
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
Need to get in that building?
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Who?
Yeah.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
What are you talking about?
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
What?  What movie?
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
She looked dead. Still does.
Where the fuck did she go?
I'm going... I'm going.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
You have to move on, Sid.
You lost your mom...
Fuck you.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
Stop it!
Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
To apologize.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
I want to talk to you for a second.
You have to have a favorite.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
What do you think I said?
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
I told you not to hang up on me.
To talk.
You getting scared?
No...
Come on, yes you do.
No it's not. It was Jason.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
What kind of lead?
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
Yeah.
What were you doing out here?
How is she?
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
Yes, sir.
I told you to send it back.
You want to go live?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Ricki Lake.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
And why is that?
So who are you?
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
You got it.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
The why'd the police let him go?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
He came to make up.
Wanna another beer?
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Why are you doing this?
Do they know who did it?
How do you gut someone?
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
It's past seven.
Whatever. Just hurry.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
And you believe it?
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
Deal.
I don't know, they just did.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
For once, Stu, drop it.
Tits -- see.
What am I? The beer wench?
Give it to me.
Thank you.
Ease back, Mills.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
No, I haven't heard.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Her pretty head.
Murderers?
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
For now.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
What?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
I know.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Bear with me.
Just wait!
No.
And you don't?
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
Oh, it's alright.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
And so what?
Him?
You got to be kidding.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
I don't see anything.
I can't do this now... please.
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
It surprises me.  It really does.
It's a hard place.
Did the wife confess?
I don't know.
How should I know?
What, Ben?
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
Huh...? No...no water.
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
Just keep goin'...
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
How many, would you say?
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
You got it with you?
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Ain't yours yet.
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
Good night...
What's that?
But I just bought a good blanket.
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
No...not yet...
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
We got two around that age...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Oh God, Tommi...
You'll never get away from me!
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Do you have a better idea?
You?
Yes, daddy.
We just have to make a new beginning.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
In the village.  Look what I found.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
What are you talking about-
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
Does this dog here belong to you?
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
I've killed my husband!
Just call me Elisabeth.
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
See you in jail.
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
Partners!
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
As soon as I have found my muse
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
How goes it, Will?
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Do you think?
I thought your play was for Burbage.
I will.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
Stand up straight, girl.
Your Majesty.
There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
I have lost my gift.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Ay me."
You have opened the playhouses?
Oh--I am him too!
Oh
Mr. Henslowe?
I must. I must
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
I will do my duty, my lord.
Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
I am going to church.
My hat?
It is only ours you can know.
A man, my lord?
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
Serve.
Will you shut up and play.
I haven't lost yet.
About what?
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
I want to talk now.
I don't know.
What's wrong?
Your friends.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
So I gathered.
About the mail --
Cover it?
Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
This is just an informal discussion.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Well, yes.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
What I am.
You're right.
David?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Is that all?
I thought we all were.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
Who?
No, I don't.
That's not him.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Don't you?
What are you doing here?
Your painful groin?
It's the only way.
You're frightened.
We were just sorting things out.
No.
What about?
did you hear anything before he cries?
Someone lost the key.
Do you smoke?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Yes.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
What?
No one. I promise.
With a face like this?
It was on the television.
Sorry?
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
You must be Juliet.
A priest who dies.
No.
It's an improvement.
I'm a doctor.
The first one was fine.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Is it real?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
Who?
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
Gee, that's very serious...
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
What?
Why don't you see Lester?
Yes.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Her?
No.
I guess so.
No thanks.
No thanks.
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
You think that's funny, don't you?
I am not like my mother!
Yeah.
She is.
Right.
Right, that's right.
I guess not...
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
He's a very private person, actually.
Probably the bathroom.
I'd cut it...
No, I'm sure.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
And what?
I won't screw you up.
What?
Did I what?
You did, didn't you?
-- this guy with Jill.
What about it?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
-- what?
He never stopped.
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
Nothing.
-- mmm --
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
Wash her.
-- Oh yeah.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- yeah, this is --
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
Honey, what happened?
I am?
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Great.
Hello.
Could I?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Who?
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
Yes.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
I just want to know, that's all.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
Jesus.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
Did you?
I see.
Yes it is.
They're not?
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah?
What about, tonight?
... this doing hair it's...
-- yeah?
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
And?
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Aren't you going to have one?
Why not?
You know what's wrong.
I'll call you.
Well, you know what I mean.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
Well, there was this one time --
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
Didn't you have any panties on?
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
That's right.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
I don't think so.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
That's fine --
No... how long did you say?
John...
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
Come here for a minute, first.
Yes, Dad.
Yeah.
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Is there something bad here?
What about Room 237?
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
Danny, come on over here.
All right.
No.
Are you having a bad dream?
Danny!
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
What line of work are you in now?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Your money's no good here.
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Yes.
Which room was it?
No, nothing at all.
Yes, I did.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Yes.
How do you like it?
I can't really remember.
Why?
Wendy!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Go away.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh...
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Well, it's very... homely.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Fine.
Let me help you up.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Will you?
Jane-
Rats...
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
Yeah.
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
Yeah... sure.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
Marty, do you see your suspect?
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
Well... thank you.
And you listen to that?
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
Today was the deadline, Vince.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
What is it, Betty?
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Because we're
Were you wicked?
Enough jabber.
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
You know that song?
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
I knew that.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Again!
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
Sing!
What?  What time is it?
Excuse me?
She won't?  Why not?
She said that?  Reverend Mother?
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Mary Clarence!
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
It's true!
Don't you know it!
What did He say?
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
What?
Are you talking about me?
What's a concubine?
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Can do.
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
Like to who?
Useless distractions.
And whom would you call?
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
Mary Clarence!
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
What do you mean?
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
Me too.
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
How?
Really.
They open a window.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
I'm telling you!
Which one?
That's what I figured, too.
She's praying.
We're losing it.
That should have tipped us.
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
It's better than ice cream.
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
She said they were from her old convent.
But where?
How did you hear this?
Two days... ?  For murder?
I was afraid of this.
To place it inside its coffin.
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
Hmm?  See them?
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
A fine idea.
Well... that might be... helpful.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
I'm sure I don't know.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
True enough.
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Stay back.
What does it mean?
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
It was not butchery.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
What did you say?
And, what did he say?
What would you have me believe?
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
I... I can't do this.
You are from the Hollow?
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
I can't remember.
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
You got any money?
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Can I see him?
You have any biscuits for sale?
What you got that's good to eat?
French-fried potaters.
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
Don't tell me what to do.
It went real good.
Would y'all like that?
No sir.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
I hate you!
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
Why? Hi, Karl.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
You told me to come by.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
I like the way you talk.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
Yeah.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
Naw.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
I don't reckon I know.
Naw.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
A little ol' boy.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
I reckon.
Is that right?
You will? For sure?
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
I've got a feelin' today.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
He ain't ever okay to me.
Mama?
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
I ain't got no boy.
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
I want to come back and stay here.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I reckon.
I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
No ma'am.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
Did you knock on the door yet?
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
Why won't he talk to women?
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Before they were married?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
American literature. What else?
I'd love to.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
The Queen of England?
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
Hi, Auggie.
Uh, better make it one.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy?
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
Yeah, probably.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I mean, it's a good story.
Eighteen and a half years.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
I almost got married once.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
Huh?
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
What does that mean?
How the hell did you get into the building?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Well what?
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
In Manhattan?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Yeah, I can believe it.
He's dead?
What time is it?
How long have you been here?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
The end.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
I just did.
That's it. In a nutshell.
It's all right. I really do know them.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Is that your third question?
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
I did.  But the jury won't s...
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
Those aren't the facts that matter.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
And the next one...?
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
Tht was summation, Your H...
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
Yes, he was.
To my father.  Everything counts.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Still lashed to the mast.
Maybe...?
The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
I'll take two.  One for later.
I was checking the cables.
Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
I don't think so.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Sure, anything's poss...
I already said that, b...
He had no reason to.
I can't speak for him.
That's all he said.
Yes.  And that one, too.
Bye.
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
It's entirely mutual.
Hey, she's ticklish!
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
No we're not.
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
Quiet - I'm thinking.
I told you - it's a sure thing.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
Knock it off, will you?
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
I never did like the name Geraldine.
You tore it again!
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
Then pull the emergency brake!
Good night, Josephine.
I got pinched in the elevator.
You - you -
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I'm engaged.
Security.
What?
Shut up and keep packing.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Get me Room 414.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
We're not on the pier yet -
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
No, no.
That's ridiculous.
I'm fine.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
I'm just going to get some ice.
Oh yes, we do!
Well, I'll come back later.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Yes.
This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
I am Cinderella the Second.
Personally, I'm Type O.
I'm not surprised.
Goodbye?
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Flower girl.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
We won't breathe a word.
Why?
Yes, Joe.
My car?  Why, you -
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
I'll say.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
You are?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
Would you mind terribly?
My fault.
Not very likely.
You're society girls?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
I am?
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
It's all right for a bachelor.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Completely.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
Nothing at all?
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Thanks just the same.
What is it?
I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
Mineral baths - now really!
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Good morning.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
Booze.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
What for?
Or Kat....
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havent made up since.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
I had to say something to get you here.
Yeah, kind of.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
What?
But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Yeah?
When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Youre funny.
Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Its my job.
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
Make out with you for free.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
Uh huh...
That's right--
What's his name?
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
Yes mam...
Yes, mam...
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
Hi, Daddy...
He'll show up one day.
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Goodnight to you, son...
They gone to the field...
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
Children, come here...
David, come back here!
No mam -- I looked all over.
Yes, mam...
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
He can't get up, Mama!
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
I'm used to it.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Might be...
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
Will they give him a trial?
Behold my glory.
My head hurts.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
I said -
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
Very funny!
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
I saw him last night!
How the fuck should I know!!
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
Oh.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
No you can't Kenny!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
Eric, that is not appropriate.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Norwegian Ass Raper.
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
Eric?
Hey, Chef.
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
MPH RM!!!
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
FREEZE!!
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
We can't leave without you!
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
YOU BASTARD!!
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
What is 'fisting'?
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Huh?
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
Yes?
I sure did, Phillip!!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
You don't care.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
No! It can't be!
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
Yup.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
He's shutting off the air!!!
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna...
It can't be.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
The device has stopped responding.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Well shut it off at once!
Well it's a good thing that I did.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
That's me.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
That's clear.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Just don't move around too much.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Seen one like it before?
Why can't we?
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
I can't!
You too.
It would matter to us.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
Send it back if you don't want it.
Baby, take it easy.
One moment please...  one moment please...
You're not from around here, are you?
The pin machine?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
When you get a chance.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
It was a clearance.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
I'd buy it!
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
I'm not on the tour this year.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
It's mine.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
I didn't think so.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen.
You know who I am?
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
How Mr. Kastle?
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
You still got the touch Junior.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Whips...orange whips.
Coming right up.
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
So, what about you?
Nothing.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
So why do you stay?
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
I could let them go for ten.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
You got any broken bones?
Why not?
It's Junior, isn't it.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
What about plan C?
I'm not here to bowl.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Open it, Captain!
Fletcher, I want you back here.
I can't...
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
What is it?
How long will that be?
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
High Voltage?
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Now!
Pull it, damn it!
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Press?  No, I haven't.
What?
Geologists?
I don't know.  That's the point.
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
She should've known better.
When was this?
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
What the hell is going on here?
Well, where the fuck is he?
They've left, keep watching!
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
A break for what?
What's the message?
What -- you want me to retype it?
She's not gonna know.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
What is it?
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
What's inside the sphere.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Beth --
You did, didn't you?
You bastard.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
The refridgerator.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Manifested?
But how?
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Valdomet.
How long does it last?
How fast does it take effect?
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
You want to kill him?
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
What do you mean, different?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
No, he can't.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
It's not safe for you to be either.
Leave me alone, Norman.
C'mon --
By the bunks.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Just in time for what?
Another attack?
I'm not being defensive.
Whatever I can do to help.
To what?
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Am I?
You don't understand about the sphere.
I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
I thought she was with you.
How do we decode it?
The three of us.
Shut up and open the door.
Hold on.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
No idea.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
What is it, Harry?
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Meaning?
"We are friends".
Thank you.
Really?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Huh?
Who's everyone?
Please, Ted.
Unless it's an act.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Don't be so supportive, honey.
What?
I don't know.
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
We'll be back before you are, old man.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
How can you store an energy field within you?
He's bluffing...
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
What are you saying?
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Why didn't you say so before.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
We'll send a squad up.
With four casualties?!
Who is this?  What's your operating...
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
It's what I deserve.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
What about it, Diz ?
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
What's the hurry ?
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
Ace of spades.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
A funeral.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Your turn...
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
I don't want everyone to see.
You two have so much in common.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
No thanks, Diz.
You saying you didn't ?
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Keep trying, Sergeant.
AAAAAAAAAAA !
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
No, sir.
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Hi, mom.
The Rodger Young just burned up...
Yeah, that's right.
Been better, buddy.
What is it, Rico ?
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir !
What's going on, Diz ?
Yes, sir !
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
To join with him.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
The Creator has not answered.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
<U>Answer</U>!
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
By the Creator.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
May I ask Why?
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Sit down, please.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
Any reply from them?
I am seeking answers, Captain.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
We're ready, sir.
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
Sure plan to.
I need a typewritter.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
What's it called?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Yes.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Yes.
Yes...
I understand...
Goodbye.
Mmm.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Cast stood me up.
I don't drink.
One moment.
The other side.
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
<u>Please</u>...
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
What?
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Is it...
It does?
You know what else a man can do?
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
But that's what happened.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
Carla was in the car, right?
...you think that's right...
I'm going to tell the truth.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Courthouse back in town.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
...they run on water.
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
What'll I do for fun?
I loved it...he...
I'm having dinner with W...
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
Sure, what have you got?
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
Of course he...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
You have to what?
It's night.
There's other things to be learned.
The Mayor's outside.
Thank you.
I think he's moved...
Then what is the...?
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
I...
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
Yes, yes, but...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
I'll put the, in your r...
That isn't very nice.
You said <u>three</u>...?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Main Street.
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
Later for you, pal.
How about that.
Yes.
My wife just went into labor...
A witness to what...?
The writer.
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
I don't drink.
Where have you been...?
I hurt my finger.
I'm gonna nail it.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
I'm out.
I have to tell the truth.
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
I don't...
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
We don't have the money.
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
...it is?
So we just got lucky.
Bet you did.
...we can't lose the wind...
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
What are you gonna talk about?
Or blush.  You look pale.
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Like how?
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
And...?
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
Don't. Take me with you.
Until he's old enough to read.
I'll miss you so much.
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
Honey, she won't d...
That doesn't bother me.
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
You owe me a quarter.
Cos she loves you.
Fine.
Then have a donut --
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
No!  I have to get there.
Rache can do that part.
You dying.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
But you're not <u>done</u>!
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
You think I didn't get that?
Don't do this.
And I'm supposed to care.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Not personally.
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Yes?
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
Wowie.  How wonderful!
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
We can't live like that.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
No.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
Are we.
Don't be too sure.
Give 'em my number.
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Aw.
You weren't passing 'em out.
Oh please.
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
You're the hip and fresh.
I have their past.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
We have to talk.
Jesus.
They don't hate you --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
Well, they will be.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Maybe he's gay.
Hey. What's up?
Oh.
Thanks, Scoob.
He was in a concentration camp?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
I'll be your guest!
Great to be here.
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Four brothers and five sisters.
I'm always working.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
My baby.
My grandchild-baby.
He's dead.
For rape and murder.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
How was the class?
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Fine.
What's tomorrow?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Tired of this shit...
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
One in a million recover.
Gee, you're home early!
Thanks.
Say, Ni...
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Any books you like to read for fun?
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Yeah.
Eight, six, and four.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
I know.
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
You should be.
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Y-yes--
Who's got matches?
We're outta here--
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
There's the fence...
I guess not Cooper...
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Where does it lead?
Are you going to kill us?
You're going to pay for this...
She's still alive.
What do you mean?
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Dissent?
Moffo!
At his office in the Capitol.
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Oh, yes, that's right.
See!  See, I told you.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
What is your name, young lady?
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
No, sir.
Plan-R????
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
You're damned right they are.
Just a squirt.
To peace on earth.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
What the hell is Plan-R?
They're coming in now.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Roger. One-three-eight.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
What?
War?
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Maximum ECM!
They're moving apart.
Sure, I'll take her up right now.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Very interesting.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Primary trigger switch.
Seond safety.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
He's dead.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
But who would be chosen?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Knock yourself out.
Intense.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Was it okay?
Typical male.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
What's it about?
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
What?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
Sorry.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
What, they're looking for her?
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
No.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Come on.
Wait, what happened to the tree?
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
In what way?
Buff is funny. God.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Hey, thanks, man.
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Okay.
It's nice here. It's different.
He is?
He is.
It's a mistake to think that.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
Two-fifty? They go up?
He's drunk.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Ask your girlfriend.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
No.
That chick, Erica?
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
You don't know?
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Nazeer Chaudry!
Hey!
What? What do you stand for?
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Typical male.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
I would've stopped it.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
I don't know.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Is that a threat?
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Well, what about us?
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
So how's college?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
What do you mean?
You know what I'm saying?
Burnfield. No place like it.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Hey!
Look at you!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Yeah.
Mine too.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
I don't know. I say what I mean.
That's because I am.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
You do?
Oh, my god!
Nobody's fucking anybody!
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
If you hit me...
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
I'm here.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
No car.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
And they get caught!
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
Y'think?
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
We're here for you, Diane.
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
He Ikea'd us.
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Hold on...
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
But you're not married.
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
Bank branch!
My what?
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Let it ride for a while.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
I'll take it.
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
Why, you sweet kid.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
You did?
I tell you this is half sold.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
We're engaged.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
Nobody can be that busy.
You're tough, all right.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
Nice job.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Why did she call me?
No.
Come on, Joe.
If you love me, Joe.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Get out!
Yeah?
Fair enough.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Thank you.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --

Just follow me.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
I ran into some people I knew.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Good.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Wipe your feet!
Good.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
That's right.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Frankly, no.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
This is the staircase of the palace.
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
It's for your own protection.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
You love me?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
You don't like me? You hate me?
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
But I don't understand.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
Hmmm?
A passionfruit smoothee.
I could force you.
Well...I guess I can't.
Why George, are you proposing?
I've got things to do.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Can you create life?
This is all your clothes?
You're not...an orphan are you?
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
I'm Linda Lee.
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
I know.
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Zaltar!
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Clark.
It sure is.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Can I help?
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
We get together sometimes.
Say!
Yeah.
Kitchen. . . Technician
What about this week's check?
So where is all them half-centses?
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
Uh...
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
For what?
You designed it?
What will it do?
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
We gonna crash?
We back in Metropolis?
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
What about me?
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Turn on the light.
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Hello.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Storms! Floods!
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
What's wrong?
Where did it come from?
Don't bet on it!
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Lois, I . . .
Oh come on, that's ridic -
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Let's get you inside . . . .
Oh, hi.
Lois, I really don't see why --
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
I'll be alright.
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
Sensible enough.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Put down Lex Luthor?
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
Free!
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
. . . Let me get my purse.
I'm sorry to see you go.
I'm not so sure you do.
Like me?
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Go on . . .
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
What?
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
First, I have fun.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
We're running out of smoke.
Got it? Otis?
What's she doing in California?
I will.
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Actually, she's silver-haired.
Oh.
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
You're not the only one.
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
We just take it?
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
There was a recipe on the back  --
But so is Vond-El
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
What's your name, boy?
He will be odd, different.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Twenty-four.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Right on the first guess.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
It's not bad.
Thirty-five.
What about it?
Very much.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
Otis...
It is for me.
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
Which one?
Which clinic?
Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
No you don't.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Yeah.
And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
I'm not sure.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
A while.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Good night.
Yes.
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
And they loved Bear.
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Yes.
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Hi, Dolores.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
Yes.  It's a present.
It's the truth.
That's what he said.
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
Yes.
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
So he was mean?
You seem very sure about that.
Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
And what was the weather like at this time?
There's the Prescots...
Crafts?
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
Tell me about it.
So what's the problem?
Yes.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Don't you want to hear?
I need money.
Is there shrimp on it?
In what way?
Any criminal record?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
You remember that much?
Yes.
Why were you scared?
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
Don't even try to remember.
The ramp?
Very slick.
It's okay.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
The Ottos.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Alone or surrounded?
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
I'm late for a date with a dame.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Did Sidney tell you about it?
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
No...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Now don't kid a kidder.
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
I'll listen one more minute.
Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
- He's got them on him.
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
You're sure.  Find out for me.
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
But what?
May I rent you out as an adding machine.
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
That's no way to talk...
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
Steve, stop it please...
Why did you call me?
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
What chip?
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
I would.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Smile?
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
What?
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
So do you.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Why attack Russia?
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
I don't know.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
What museum?
No can do.
Yes.
Yes.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
What's not right?
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
And what did he say?
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
Do you know what's in this archive?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Show you?
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
One of my people?
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
His private life?
Jeez, and I never heard of him.
Absolutely not.
You're late.
I won't let the fat kid down.
All.
Great.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Right.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
It's okay.  Forget it.
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
You like it?  It's my first.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Good fighters.
Someone?
Kyle...
Why?
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
Who is in authority here?
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I just called.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
Shut up.
Now, look...
Did you?  Kudos.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Please, don't do that...
It was an accident.
I said I was sorry...
Oh, no... you.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
What... is... happening... ?
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
Where are you going?
How do you know that's the way?
You first.
What's C.R.S.?
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
I thought...
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
What are you talking about... ?
What do we do?
Nicholas...
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
... what... ?
We searched the house.
Fuck you.
That's not true...
Stop it!
Claire.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Big family... small?
Studied acting, I assume?
Single?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Which grad-school?
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
Fun?
Are you still on mediction?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
Really?
You're part of it...
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Stop this.  It's not true...
Stop it!
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Yes.
There's nothing to forgive.
Of course, Nick...
What kind of vacation?
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Look, where is he?!
No.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
You're joking.
You warm my heart.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Who's Watts?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Yeah.
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
Luke.
You could have.
No.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
I got more scared.
It was.
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
No --
Good.
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Nell, what do we do?
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
Fifteen dollars.
It's all I could afford.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
I have a loft.
I don't know, you know...
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Just had to be sure.
Is that a problem?
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
Why?
I'm sorry.
Not bad.
Let him break - he likes to break.
I wouldn't talk.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
Round about, yeah.
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
Terry Valentine.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
I only asked.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
That would be too easy.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
What post office?
Not much -- you?
Not her brand.
It's been a while.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Try calling me again.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Up the coast.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
He had urgent business in the north.
Yeah?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Where else?
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Good luck.
I don't know.
Lemme break.
Something's on.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
I doubt it.
What do you think?
What are you doing here?
No trouble.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Are you finished?
Tell me.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Who?
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
Well? How'd she do?
Huh.
Ed.
Way out of line.
It's OK.
That'll be fine.
Mm.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
...Huh?
I, uh...
How's that?
It was Big Dave's.
*I* was with her.
I'm fine. Thanks.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Uh-huh.
Huh?
That's very generous.
Hello, Walter.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
Ah.
Homicide.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
He said OK. Is that what he said?
It better be good.
I appreciate that.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
What doors?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
You're kidding.
I believed them.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
Correct.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
I know.
Oh shit.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Read it out loud.
I don't believe it.
Yes, I do.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
What is it?
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
He's right.  Follow me.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Another storage room.
Margo, you haven't heard?
Okay.
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
What happened?
Gone.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
The planetarium!
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
It's scared of me.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
Oh God!  Help!
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
<i>A month.</i>
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
No, hold back...
All prop cars accounted for?
What have we missed?
What music?
Thank you.
That and a fat, new contract.
It has to be the reality.
A window onto the human condition?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
You're the star.
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
Oh, yes.
That's right.  Lauren.
Saturday?
I...I can't.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
This is where it started.
Yeah...
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
Oh, my God!
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
I think I'd like a little company.
I bet you did.
Do something...
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Things always do--when you look back.
I don't understand.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
Yeah.
We don't even know you.
Me?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
You got some kind of business with him?
Looking for him for what?
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
Before the bomb went off?
Not according to the men in blue.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
What did it look like?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
How's that?
No you didn't.
Nice try, Mulder.
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
I was until about an hour ago.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
According to this tag.
I'd been told as much.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
All the equipment is brand new.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
I don't know why I think they went right.
This is great. This is fitting.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Very weird.
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
Where are we?
General McAddie's.
I don't know anything about that.
Thank you.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
How deep does this go?
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
He needs to be turned over.
I'll be fine.
No.  No.
I don't need them anymore...
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
's broken.
I need you to find something in the basement...
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
Yes.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Awaiting his arrival.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
Ja, ja, ja.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
He was Harry's driver?
They're forged.
Dr. Winkel.
Well you read this.
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Anna.
I thought you wanted...
We're both in it, Harry.
Yes.
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
His.
Thank you.
They're Harry's.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
Just around the corner.
No, not yet.
It wasn't petrol.
Calloway.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
She's right. It's none of my business.
All right, Calloway. You win.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
Two thirty.
Take him to Sacher's.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
Certainly.
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
You can help her.
As long as they can use you?
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
Here?
A Roumanian.
What's the name of this girl?
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Yes.
I have guests waiting.
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
Must be some mistake.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Lime - yes.
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
What else?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Not when I get interested.
Never.
Okay.
Yes?
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
I don't think so.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
Why?
So?
What!
Not too bad.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Richard, you know something -
Uh-huh.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
Then I won't bring you....
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
He's at a home out here.
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
What do you care?
What assholes.
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
Who's Eichmann?!!?
What'd you say?
I'm stealing it.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
How would you kill him?
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
Listen to me....
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
I can't help what I think.
With the shoes... There was more than one?
You're lying.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Daniel Balint.
From the Rhineland originally.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Fine.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
The mother.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Why? Why would she?
Where?
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Wow, that's uh...great...
Shut up...
What are you trying to say?
No.
Funny?
Valentine...
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
... So am I.
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
No.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
Lira?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
No...
Enzo...
Yes, I know.
What room have you got?
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you very much!
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
I can't.
How do you know that?
It's me again.
... Nothing.
You go back, I'll walk.
Anything.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
What?
I brought Johana to meet you.
You called the police?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Coffee might be nice.
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
... Yes?
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
I forgive you.
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
A stereo type alarm system?
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Good looking?
Nice fellow?
What about me?
I drink.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Let's get in your truck.
You found the leopard!
Where? Where did you find it?
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
Good evening.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
I want to ask you something.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
That was a calamity!
Thanks, Sheriff.
Go on foot.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
And I never will- you know what's between us  we're a thing But this is serious competition.
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
Yeah.
The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
What! You can't be --
I know -- Teresa -
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
And that is the last time any...
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Disney! How inter...
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
You drive a hard bargain.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Sorry?
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. Whats harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
Leon hung himself...
...You-you spoke to him?
Leon could still have hung himself.
I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...
You bastard...
Should I?
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. Theyll tell you. Call them!
Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
I thought youd never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... Theres a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
I know where to look.
Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Italian? The Mafia...?
What about your friendly cop?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
Shell be alright. Shes tough...
This is a bad line.
Yeah.
Yes... Good, good...
Who?  Martin... Hes Martin...
Yeah... The Diplomat.
The company. We all work for the company.
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe...  I need a doctor...
Ill call again.
La what?
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelquun récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie...
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
Your secretary, huh!
Recommended?
Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonards address, keys and other things you might need.
When... Im told he came here...
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
We conclude our transaction.
Does it matter?
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go...
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
Yeah.
An Austrian.
Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Good reasons?
Im afraid I dont understand.
Do you know Leons parents names?
Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
Hed come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... Sleeping Beauty. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldnt watch...
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Hows the boy doing?
Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Would you know where I might reach her?
Then why dont you reach him?
If you can, send me a receipt.
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
Thats what he said...
Shut up and walk...
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Now?
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
But it is what I want.
Sound the retreat...
I don't remember.  Maybe.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
To avoid killing anyone.
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
And when was that?
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Scared of a girl?
No no, I'm fine, really...
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
But... her army's so small now...
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
Noooo!
If there was, I didn't see it...
Go and ask him yourself.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
Damn right!
Me too...
Yes.  We can pray.
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
I... submit to Our Lord.
No...
No...!
That's now what I meant...
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
I'd sooner die than use magic!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Yes!
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
Really?
Good.  But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
And what does he say to you?
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
Why did she have to die?
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
Just over a year.
What are you doing?
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
What, I'm working, what?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
What?
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Who's recruiting?
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
Hungry.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Yes, but what good did it do?
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
There are always notices going up.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
You made contact?
Stop it, Wladek.
No, I don't think so?
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
I am... I was a pianist.
We're getting out.
Not yet.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
It will be very dramatic.
... without a shred of manners.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
That is good, yes.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
Spoken words?
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
He chopped it off
It's my mother's piano.
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
What will I play?
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
That's right.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
What do we do?
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
I had some appointments.
All of it.
You think my play is bad?
What?
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
He was a con man, wasn't he?
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Which one?
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
Hackers.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
No, not a thing.
Did he say he wouldn't?
It was too noisy.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Five and call.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
But what about all these other people?
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
What the hell for?
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
Give 'em a little time.
Why don't ya then.
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
No.
Don't think I know him.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
We missed him.
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
It's all right.
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
Just a minute...
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
Nothing.
I didn't.
He's waiting for you.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
tried him once -
Oh, thank heaven.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Which way did she fall?
He's been dead for three months.
Forgive me.  How are you?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
What do you mean?
I think we're on the right track.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Rosebreen.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
No.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
--was Wynant's.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
Did you go?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Want to take a poke at him?
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
All right.  All right.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
What bonds?
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
That's all right.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
But suppose some business comes up...
What'll I do if something comes up?
Is Julia going with you?
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
I haven't been a detective for four years.
Slim.
Hello, Mimi.
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
They'll want more than your word for that.
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
This is your party.
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
Take it easy.
I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
They were kidding you.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
You did.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Your guess is as good as mine.
You talk as if I were Asta.
Catch me letting you go alone!
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
Smart gal.
No.  Nobody but you.
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations.
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I don't know.
No, Mr. Charles.
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Yes.
I know I left them there.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right --
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
No, please, not again.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
You just go when I say go.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
I heard!
All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
Then get up and do something about it.
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
We thought--
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
There might be.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Wait.  Wait.
Wh-what do you think--
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
We leave it.
Mine.
I heard it click.
I heard it.
Epps...
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
It's a fire fight.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
So where do we start?
What?
We'll find our way!  We'll...
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
You sure you want me too?
Okay.  Then we go this way.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
Probably.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
Threatened to blow my brains out?
What?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
How the hell should I know?
We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
What?
Like I said; so?
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
What?
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Yeah, we're down.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Now.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
Don't be so sure.
What?
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
They don't know.
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
Incredible!
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
But you can't...you.
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
All the insides are gone!
No!....
No......  She's dead THX........
What do you want?
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
Yes...
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
Hang on.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Mike Reilly.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Where...?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Yep.
`Til we get a better lead.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Me, too.
Right.
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Nothing.
Don't touch that.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Helluva fuck factor.
A bowling alley.
Reilly! He's loaded!
Thank you.
Stay here.
Stay in the truck.
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
Look who's talking, old man.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
What?
Captain assigned me to assist you.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Report on the case so far.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Diamonds all over.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
Where did you find it?
No.
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
Constantinople?
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Umm.
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
The type they marry.
Nice suit.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
I hope so, too.
Um-hum!
No, not at all!
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Just as you say, Doctor.
Ah!
Certainly!
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?
I know that niche.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
No. What is it? Tell me.
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Talk? About me--about us?
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I know it.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
Please!
No--thirty-five!
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Yes, Madame Colet?
I don't want your money!
He started it.
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
Don't drop it Rose.
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
Don't you mean work me?
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
What do I tell your mother?
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
We've struck ice.
If only it were that simple.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
No, no! Just with her hands.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
This is crazy.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
Right.
I can't feel my body.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
That's enough.
You think she was really there?
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Sure!
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
That's a date.
We'll save you a place at our table.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
And me coming in with two pair--
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
I'll say she is!
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
So you washed it off!
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Very--your mother?
Well, I can't.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
Sorry.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
You mean that?
Good night, idiot!
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
What do you know about them?
Jimmy!
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
<U>Me</U>!
Get it!
Oh, yes. On the pier.
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Why?
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
What'll I say?
How?
In New York.
Back is in New York.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
No. <U>Knots</U>!
So what?
I thought I put you to bed.
Is this your gun?
Like it?
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
What do you mean?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
Not a chance--I'm through.
Good night!
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Hey--you! Where you going?
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Then why did you run away?
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Absolutely nothing.
Beauty, ain't he?
Come and get him.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
You retired, too?
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Enough?  Never.
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
In vino veritas.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
That's great coming from you.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Not half as bad as I feel.
Good God, you're really-
Wyatt, are you crazy?
I know.  Me neither.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
Where do you get these questions?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
Wait!
No really, I can stay a while.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
'Least they don't scare women.
All right, run 'em off.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
I'll be damned...
I know.  And nobody can make him.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Morg, use your head.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Sir Elliot.
I see.
So why did you leave?
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
- We all want what we can't have?
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Do you?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Fishing?
Not from forty feet.
I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Interesting video tape.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
Think about mom.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
You are seriously deranged.
... We have time for that?
I didn't say when I want to die -
Now.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
I am. What do you want?
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
I see you two have met.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
Approaching the first gate.
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
You come with me -  You stay here.
Fueled and waiting.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
I don't know. He's not in the database -
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
They're too big.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
Maybe I can get down there next week.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
Will you still get the money from your father?
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
What for?
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
It would be nice.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
You should go back and rest.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
You must have done something to her.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Now who are we talking about?
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
I was just trying to make conversation.
You know the man next door is near death.
Okay...
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
What?  What is it?
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
You mean that happy child?
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Alright Buzz, get ready...
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Don't tell me what to do!
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
What?!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
I can't see a thing!
Miss.  G-6.
Heh-heh.
How 'bout three out of five?
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
A lunchbox...?!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
You murdering dog!
I was close to being scared that time.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
I thought he was at summer camp!
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
Sid!!!
Huh?
It's busted.
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Got it.
Excuse me.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
She'll have to learn.
Go away.
You're not so old yourself!
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
I've got a present for you...
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
All the time.
Nothing is left but us.
We're too young.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
I don't know what you mean.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Nine thousand dollars.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
I don't know.
What do you think?
Just watching you.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
You can't make me.
Yes.
I'm third in my class.
What is this, like freebase?
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Who do you work for?
When will you do it?
You're breaking my heart.
Yes, sir!
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
Yeah.
I don't know.  Something.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
An informant.
It was an anonymous tip.
I'm aware of that.
It could mean that, yes.
Noriega is a criminal.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
Just tell me where she is.
I don't know what to say.
You won't say anything to my parents?
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
Agents who died in the field.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
No. On you go.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Bit fucking late, like.
I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
Thanks.
Diane.
What?
Ssshh!
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Smells like it.
Too young for what?
It's Iggy Pop.
Eh? How's that?
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
Roald Dahl.
So who else?
Give me the gun.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
What?
You're all hear.
Fuck you.
We're two thousand short.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Well, it's up to you.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Sure will, pal, sure will.
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
But where?
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
You doubt me?
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
My pain?
Rescued at last.
Pavel.
Raise shields.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Join my quest.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
If we could send a distress signal...
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
Are we leaving, Captain?
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Yes, Spock?
Go to sleep, Spock.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
I cannot be certain.
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
Captain, what have I done -
If you think it would help.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
That's a little vague, Spock -
"c."... "k."
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
The emergency channel, open.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
Am I? We'll see.

Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
No. You must kill me.
Do you?
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
You invented Space Paranoids?
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
I know, I met him.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
I'm certainly not.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
For sure...
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
The Pentagon?
You wouldn't dare.
No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
Yeah, I... oops!
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Yes.
How about you?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
Recognizers!
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
We have to.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
I had to...in the games...
Then I owe you some thanks...
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
What?
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.
Put a tap on her phone.
What are you talking about?
The purse is still at the house.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
Yes, sir.
They must've just missed me.
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
He needed my help.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
No.
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Yes.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
And you've got one.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
What about the husbands?
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Find out who this Renquist it.
This is great, we got cable.
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
Sure. Why not?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
Would you like to get some pie?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
Really?
That rhymes.
I heard that.
Heard that.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
I don't blame you.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
Has he gotten his mail today?
I certainly hope so.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Elliot Blitzer.
How 'bout me what?
Want an animal cracker?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Look, Dick, I don't -
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
No problems on both counts.
No. No you're not.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
I got some money I can give you -
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
I give up. Who are you?
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
What about him?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
You do.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
Read my lips.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
Underground.
It's so clean.  No germs.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
Who's keeping an eye on you?
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
I thought I was in...prison again.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
I need to make a telephone call.
What's that mean?
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
Yes, sir.
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
Then how come she knows what's going on?
I said I was sorry.
That's 'cause he's dead.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Out of here.
I don't care, just get me there.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You've been there?
You believe that?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
You got beer?
Let me have a Beck's.
Yeah, I'll try.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
John . . .
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
I just drove in this morning.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Whatever it takes.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
I can't.
Where?
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
From?
What about us?
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
What was I supposed to do?
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
Funny thing.
Give him the money.
You could give me the gun.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
A lot that means.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
How do you know if you've never tried?
About things.  About your wife.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
Is the job done?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
Darrell giving you problems?
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
I said come on!
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
She's dead.
I've had time to get over it.
You're too quick for me.
For what?
What the hell are you talking about?
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Give it to me!
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
A hundred-forty-five really.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
What happened?
Not as bad as it looks.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
And you're taking?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Christ!
That's 'cause he's dead.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Oh, shit!
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Live there?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
How do you know if you've never tried?
How do you want it?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
I've had time to get over it.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Yeah, I can fix it.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Don't look like nothing.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
What sign?
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Darrell.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
I want my car.
Eh?
I'm just going to my car?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
You're welcome, Grace.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
How do you know he's still not here?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Nothing.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
I thought you couldn't get your car.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
'Cause I love you.
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
Where to?
How much?
The ticket is 30.55.
They look nice.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
Four.
I'll keep it in my office room.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Jesus.
You assumed wrong.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
We are.
Yes he is.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
I won't make any noise.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
No.
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
How long have you been married?
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
No?
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
You ain't dead.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
She back in Kansas?
Oh.
Be careful with those, sonny.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
Oh yeah.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
What's your name?
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
And?
Is... is it... loaded?
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
No.
Huh?
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
You missed him? You didn't...?
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Lemmee see it.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
How many you killed, Kid?
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
Just like that?
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
And ?
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
Goddamnit.
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
You are a criminal.
They fucking know everything.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
County. I was in for fraud.
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Maybe more.
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
You know damn well, dead-man.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Neither do we.
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
We want to meet him.
Tell him we'll meet.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
Kobayashi.
I'm not a rat.
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
This is totally irrelevant.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Why didn't you say anything?
Then why didn't you help him?
Edie.
You think he's..?
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
I'm fine.
Nothing.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
...I was one of a group of...
Tell me one?
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
I'm just an M.D.
I am seventy-four years old.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
I completely understand ...
Hold on a second.
There's nothing they can do to me.
Yes.  I wrote it.
... and you're going to do that?
You're going to settle out of court?
Why?
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
I understand.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
You know, you're pushy, fella...
...things change.
Thank you for seeing me.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Let me talk to Mickey.
Yes.  Price...
Missus...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
And what are you?  A cop?
What...?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
They, uh, they got to my witness.
You're going to stay here...?
Isn't there something you...
I...do you want me to leave?
And what makes you so tough?
What is that to you...?
No...no...
He's not in, Sir.
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
I'm going to help her.
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
Right.
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I don't know.
It's locked.
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
Yes.
Hi.  How are you doing?
How old is he?
Mrs...
Yes...
Yes.
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes, the roving nurse...
As I've said we had some more...
Ah? That complicates the problem.
I married into it.
Almost a year.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
There are things you didn't tell me.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
I -- I --
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
Do you live here in the hotel?
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Why?
Let me come in.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Because I remind you of her?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Okay.
Can I see you tomorrow?
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Yes.
Why?!
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
They're none of them right.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Ah, no!
Wherever you'd like...
Too late. I've got my face on.
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Yes!
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
At...
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
Oh! Yes! Here!
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I enjoyed talking to you.
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
Only silence. It's always like this.
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
Vaguely...
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
Why? What's happened?
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
Let me go.
Yes.
More than you think.
Ah, Johnny-O...
What a pleasant hobby.
That's following a train of thought.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Three whole weeks.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Yeah.
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
What is it, a still life?
But you said grey, sir.
What?
First of all...
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
Why?!
You're a loser.
You go home!
You don't know what you're doing.
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
That is absolutely not true.
I am not flexible on this.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
I know...
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Sweet deal.
Here's his head.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
Shut up.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
Good God...Good God...
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
Shut up Boyd.
What did you ask me?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
What are you going to do?
Hear what?
Fine? Fine what?
It's my fucking opinion.
The hell you didn't!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
You have a King fantasy.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
What?
I do.
I'm not sure.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
Yes.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
What?
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
Who else?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
It's vile!
What kind of seats can we have?
We're leaving in three hours.
I'll call them from the road.
Hi.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
No.
The prostitute.
Micheal, by accident.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
What money?
What does that mean?
Move the bodies.
You did all right dad.
I love you dad.
I just want her to be happy.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
Have another drink.
I think so.
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
What?
Greenpeace?
The stone age.
That's our plan.
Drum banging real times.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Yes, yes.
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Don't you ever see him?
How could anybody behave like that?
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
Wasn't that cowardice?
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
You must listen to me before you go.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
She won't even know.
Yes.
He was asking for it.
Nothing.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
That your cousin is more to your taste.
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
Why did he kill himself?
Why?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Very, very?
You little liar! Get out of here!
This louse is looking for trouble.
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
I have a headache.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
But only you will know he's not human.
You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
He was a computer program for crissake.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
On my life, I promise you I will.
Got it.
Only because I got pulled out early.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
I understand... I understand perfectly.
Do I get to see it or not?
Talk so I can understand.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
That's not true, Parker.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
What you need is a collar.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
How did you get your hand out?
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Stop me.
Enjoying yourself?
Both.
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
Why's that?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
It's <u>producing</u>.
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
Indeed it is.
Wilfred, that's not bad.
He's not fine.
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"...
No, no, no...
What rig?
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks?
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
I'll see you at National.
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
Why?
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
Get on this, right now...
Due in Nashville.
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does <u>Moss</u> want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the <u>file</u>, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...
...fourteen years...
...they just hadn't thought it through...
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"...
Fine.
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
Why do people go to war?
I have.
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber.
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
...uh ... No, that's...
Because.
...it's a Teaser!
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
Oh, you're gonna love this:
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in...
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>...
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
Get on your feet, boy.
Finish Strong!  Are you <u>nuts</u>?  Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
They'll be here in ten minutes.
A proud tradition.
Deal's changed.
<u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
They look stupid.
Isn't Johnny Green in the...
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
Better.
Surest thing you know.
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
I'm just talking about the Hats.
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
...for the beans, yes...
Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
...gotta read my reports.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
How's Mom?
About what?
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
We are?
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
...I can't even see it...
I don't understand.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
How much?
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
...I can't make it tonight.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
Yeah, almost...
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
Why?
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
It's over you, Gordon.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
It's eleven forty-five let's go
Ok toots, I will.
Thank you Jenkins
Thank you
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Vell.  Goodnight.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
A little?
Safety in numbers man.
Hey.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
That's not true.
How do you know it's a she?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Yes, but...
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
Have you been hurt?
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
I don't know.
Um...yes.
This fence...it's so...
Wait!  Don't go...
Claire.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
I should be going anyway.
...just so she could cut them off.
Do we have to?
She's making this up.
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
I don't...
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Hartford?
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Relieved?
No.
If she was dangerous before--
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
I know.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Three o'clock.
Fine.
Shhh.
Mmm.
To make sure she's all right.
That's not what I'm sug--
But what if something happens?
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
A flare?
What am I looking at?
Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Then where is she?
Yep.
You told me that I was...
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
Not personally.
Yes.  The ghost.
STOP IT!
Wouldn't go that far.
Who?
What?
Oh God...
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
How did she know where it was?
It's alright.
She's gone.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
What?
Huh.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Shhhh.
But why would they do that...?
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Michael, Rowan should -
Every day  twice.
Nothing worse than a common tool.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
I under5tand.  All the same
ENOUGH!!!
You - are - a - murderer.
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Anybody got a BP yet...?
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
If you knew how I yearn for that...
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
I LOVE him!
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
I know.    you are my son -
Rowan...
I'm glad you're around to say it.
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
And whose houses do you design...?
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
What about you coming down here...?
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
Hello..
If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
That's GREAT!
That's not funny.
- we made a fire.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Gotcha.
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
You can't just -
The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
Just don't fall off any ladders.
You really love this guy...?
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Yes - I have had it for years.
Sure...
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
Yes, one and a half please.
No she didn't...
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
Why should I?
Did you?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Then make it stop...
I am sorry...
What was I supposed to do?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
At 2.00...
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
What's this all about?
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Well, Dad said...
Maybe he got promoted.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Not ever. Never.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
I better go, Dad.
Take a whiff of heaven.
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
I love those springy head puppies!
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
Let me get this straight...
These are real, live women?
We reinvented ourselves.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
From your lips, to God's ears.
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
So you'll think about it?
Which you pulled, hard!
We own a small family grocery store.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
Yeah.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
...not the pit.
I will not have my boys arguing.
Some of them have to be automatics.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
That's me.
Whatever you want.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
It's not up to me.
I didn't forget.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
I'm trying to help.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
You never know around here.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Eventually you'll let go.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
Amen to that.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Maybe someday.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
Very ambitious. I like that.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Rules are rules.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Of course I like girls.
As much as possible.
Really? You'd do that for me?
Really? So I'm doing OK?
I can't wait to see the pictures.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
Thanks.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
I'd like that.
Back to the land of grownups.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
Unless what?
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
I said he did.
Your Honor... Please...
No!
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
What brain?
Nothing.
Hi, Mon.
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
In back of the garage.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
So you got my mom's money.
About six and a half million dollars.
Do it to ourselves?
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
That's right.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
And she wanted to talk.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
We?
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Jim West.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Wouldn't dream of it.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
You need that real often?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Prepare what?
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Hey, I tried the board.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
It's better than nothing.
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Oh, thank you.
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Where have you been?
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
What is this?  A whole new train?
We'll see.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Private train?
Yes sir.
That'll be all, boys.
I deal with some tough customers.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
That would be... the Mexican War?
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Who was this partner of his?
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Yes...?
Not today, Willow.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Madmartigan.
I have no family.
As above, so below.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Why.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Friend of yours?
I will.
Of course!  I promise!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Who?
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
No!
Burn it to a fine ash.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
Courage, Willow.
The sorceress.
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Sorry. It's important.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
John, I don't understand any of this.
John, why?...
Who'd you see?
No pistol. Ever.
You don't say.
...I want to say a thing.
Oh, he's good.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Don't try me, Johnny!
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Only the elders.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
There was.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
Wrong.
I don't know where he is.
Yes.
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
I have to help him!
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
My son is out there!
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
You are?
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Oh!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
No, they won't - honestly.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
Oh, you....
Did you say something?
All hollow.  Oh --
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh! Oh!
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh --
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
I knew you would!
Yes...!
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
You're right -- I am a coward.
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Oh, come on.
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Leave her alone!
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
It did?
What was that?
Fine.  He's got a plan
Yeah. Me?
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Now...
It's a whatzis?
Don't push!
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Ohhhhhh!
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
It's a whozis?
Well, that's you all over.
Well, I --
Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
But I still want one.
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Elektra King.
Perhaps after this ... test?
I could come for a second opinion?
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
I took the initiative.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
Renard.
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
Yes.
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
I know.
I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
You can drop the act, its over.
I think you do.
Oh James.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Where did you get this?
No!  Get me out!
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
Where?
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
Someone will come.
Is it?
Yes.  Au revoir...
Its heading for the oil terminal.
Still no contact yet.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
Don't call me that.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
God isn't there to do it.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
I won't do that.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Cured, yes.
Veidt¹s complex.
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
Adrian -- you've lost it.
What if you¹re wrong??
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
Okay!
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Where did he go?
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
We should get back --  What?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Then why don't you ask him?!?
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
Am I free to go?
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
We're not after car thieves here.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Who says you're the good guys?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
You can't talk to it?
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
I thought that was in detail.
I'm through, Xander.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Been to any good diners lately?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
Its core?
I don't like him being here.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
Senator?
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
MMmmm.
Hello...?
You're incorrigible!
Yes!... the laboratory.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
Will there be anything else?
Why did you do that?
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
I beg your pardon?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
My father was a sick man.
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
But they told me it was Ee gor.
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
What wockers?
Wockers with the knockers???
Home.
Could be worse!
Could be raining!
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
... I'm glad that's...
Act casual!
Can you play it?
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
... It's.
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Ja, ja.
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Well, this explains the music.
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
I think you've done it, master.
I think so.
I know Frederick.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
Four
Food!
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Certainly, Sin
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
