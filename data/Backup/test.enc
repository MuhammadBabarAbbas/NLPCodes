The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Why?
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
There.
You have my word.  As a gentleman
She's not a...
Have fun tonight?
But
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
She okay?
Did you change your hair?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Great
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
Why didn't you tell me?
Let go!
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
You the new guy?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
That girl -- I --
Why not?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
What about him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Number one.  She hates smokers
Her favorite uncle
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
You makin' any headway?
Leave my sister alone.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You need money to take a girl out
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I just upped my price
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
He always look so
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
I say, do what you wanna do.
You're not okay.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
Why?
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
Tell me something true.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
Is that a request or a command?
No.
Answer the question, Patrick
Wait I...
I know.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
My insurance does not cover PMS
As a parent, that's my right
Was that your sister?
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
In the microwave.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
You can see for yourself.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Are we going to argue?
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
What is it, now?  Tell me...
How are you feeling, Fernando?
What are you listening to?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Chief knows.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Father Marchena!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Colon!
What are you saying?
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I suppose we're both old men now.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
... Into a monk...
I'm coming with you.
...delusions and paranoia.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Now I become custody of police department?
I can't take you to my place.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
What about back home?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
I'll make some for us.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Are you hit?
No.
You know what that is, right?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Hmmmm.
Mind if I ride along with you?
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Yeah.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
How many victims are up there?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Eddie, are you okay?
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Stop it.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Promise?
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Tell him to put his gun down!
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Who is he?
This all you want?
In here, says he wants a million.
Turn that fucking thing off!
I did.
I'm serious.
We spent it!
Yes, the money is good.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Well, he...
I'm here for movies.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.

Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
It's about my salary cheques.
Really.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
You're kidding.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two more.
Hal?
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.

CONINUED
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
And your charming little daughter?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
That's right.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
I see.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
That's true
I understand.
This is three years old.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Pay money?
I never paid for it in my life.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
I'm candy...
You're in a hurry.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
You here to write my life story?
Yeah, I noticed...
Bullshit.
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
No way to start a partnership.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
What do you think?
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We eat when I say we eat.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
Where's the money?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
That was in style a couple years back, man.
What about Luther?
We missed.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
That was quick.
Why?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
What am I wanted for?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
No wonder you're so popular.
Hello.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
How do you know?
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Three more hours...
Who the hell are you?
Surprise, Luther.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Billy, go ahead, break it...
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
Five.  On credit.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
...would you like a drink?
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
We have to save the world.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
It's a miracle!!!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
What's she doing?
They really made her...
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
Hello?
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Is that all?
Don't you open your messages?
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Dinoine chagantakat!
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Finished what?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
...Like love...
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Okay, I believe you.
How's the detective business?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
Who are you calling?
Anything harder?
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
You're a dead man.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Yeah, who's this?
What?
Who is this.
What's he talking about?
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
How old are you?
What about me?
A daughter.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Who is he?
Who is he, his name?
What's this?
He succeeded.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
You don't have any other choice.
Nothing remotely like this.
Okay.
You told me to look, so I looked.
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
What was she running from?
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
Do you think the police did a good job?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Do you know what happened to her?
Her belongings?
No, sir, he is not.
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Rick...I can't.
Alice, you think you can leave?
You alright?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
You've been up all night?
I've been working double shifts.
What the hell was that?
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
I don't get it.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Hi, beautiful.
The tickets.
About him?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Very funny.
You disappointed in me?
Alice!
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
You think that's the place she's buried?
But how are we gonna --
You do good work, Alice.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Where are you going?
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
It's okay.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
How is he - ?
What is it?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
I think you're right.
You hear that?
Course and speed?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Excuse me, Skipper---
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
As we near the Pole...
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
Swell!
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Are you alright, Wade?
Who?
Who?
You don't believe me?
No.
You heard the news.
He's on to us!
We bought you.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
You might not kill it.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
No brag. Just fact.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
You stayed away?
Why do they do that?
You know.
Was it funny?
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
What then?
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
Dad.
That's illegal, you know.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
On what you pay me?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
You? Why?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You don't mean that.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
I know your parents.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Who are you?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Take care, Wade.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
You talked to Jack?
Rolfe.
Just do it.
Where's Ma?
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Daddy...
How you doing, sweetie?
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
How did your speech go?
I don't know why you stayed.
Did they say anything about my family?
Yeah, right.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
You wanna knock of f?
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
Elaine.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
Ted!  What are you...?
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Elaine, what's going on?
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Ted, the lever!
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
That's not possible.
Request; life support systems check.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
He's a boy dog.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Striker.
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
But Ted, you're the only...
Ted...
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
We have a visitor.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Hi!
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
He didn't recognize me.
What is wrong?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Tell me.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
You know that guy?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
Yeah... I know the routine.
Was.  Divorced.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
Well, let's roll, George.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
But there's no more drug.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
How can I go?
You got your vest?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Movement!
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
I'll go.
Ripley...
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Have they located my daughter yet?
Is she...?
You son of a bitch.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
How do you feel?
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Save it.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
We got problems.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Range twenty meters.
And how are we today?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Are we going to sleep now?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
How do you know?
Did you know? Had you heard?
What did you think of the music?
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
And how will you make him keep it?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Now?
Stop it!
No, I'm not playing this game.
No!
Yes, my love?
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Who was that?
Why not?
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
I see.
Come back tonight.
Why you?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
He's adorable!
What a strange young man.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Yes, where?
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
Yes.
What's that?
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Are you playing a trick on me?
Father -
Is he working?
What did he say? What did he say?
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Love, Sire!
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
You burned the score?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Yes?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
What?
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Confutatis Maledictis.
The Fire.
With the tenors.
Do you have me?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Do you want to rest a bit?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Herr Mozart -
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
So?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Are they?
Where?
Well?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
Oh my son, my poor son!
Are you absolutely sure?
Where?
Ballet? What ballet?
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
That lady is back, sir.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
Did he say a wolf?
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Yes.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Surely you're not suggesting...
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Do you like it?
What do you dream about?
I'm twenty-seven.
What? Oh, yes, please.
The kitchen.
Closet.
The bedroom.
But, David.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
Hello, Benjamin.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
I think he's a Jew.
Miss Price.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
There's no call for that kind of language.
Who is this girl?
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Lunatic?
Yes.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
Okay.
Nice looking group.
What about it?
What do you think was wrong?
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Heathcliffe.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Shit! David, what is that?
It's moving.
See anything?
It sounds far away.
Thanks a lot.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Jack, are you really dead?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
You look awful.
Yes?
What here?
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
About twenty-four thousand.
Let me have ten bucks?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I
Where you been?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
know, but
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Why, Cyril, you're insane
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Good morning.
I don't know.
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Oh!
Helen!
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
The lobby's half filled now.
Yes, sir.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
He was in the bank yesterday.
What did you find out, Mike?
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
What time did you get in?
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
Uhh, yeah it does.
This is the best score yet.
How'd they --
How many of them did he kill?
What?
How?
Where you boys going?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Not now.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
Dammit!
Missed you, cousin.
Where'd you get all these riders?
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Cannon or Gatling?
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
What?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What the --
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
Such as?
Hell of a war.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
You know him?
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Ma! Please!
But still died.
Jesse, are you awake?
Teasing you is completely unfair.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
Not if I find the right girl.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Let the law --
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Don't turn around.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Don't swear.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
You okay, Jesse?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Just perfect.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
What is that?
How did you know?
This is no game.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Dorsia's nice.
You like it there, don't you?
Okay. Yeah. What time?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Luis is a despicable twit.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
That's nice.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
I haven't seen you around here.
Really?
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Yes, darling?
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Why? What's wrong?
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Listen, what about dinner?
Don't come back.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Patrick? Is that you?
What...is...it?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
Dorsia.
Dorsia, yes?
I said we are totally booked.
Late?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
After six.
Anywhere you want?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Forget it.
Welt...it depends, why?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
Yeah.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Coffee?
Oh no, I'm okay.
Understandable.  Lime?
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Your address?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
How well did you know him?
He had a yacht?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Have you consulted a psychic?
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I've questioned him.
Yes.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
Shhhh...it's okay.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
It's important.
...But?
They hack into people's programs?
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
Great!
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
Milo?
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
You're living here?
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
Milo? I'm Danny.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
'Think I should buy some originals?
I heard what happened.
Had you talked to him much lately?
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
That's great! Thanks.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
Okay, #2.
Gary?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
What're we looking for?
...Were you?
Did you wanna be alone?
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
...Milo?
What about the FBI?
Time?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Maybe it's the satellite.
...You got my E-mail?
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
Yes.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Where am I?
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Yes?
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
What's wrong with your hand?
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
Oh, yes you are.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
No, did you use a condom?
What do we do now?
I'll hurry back.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Everything seems to be in order.
Shut up.
Commander, I have to log it...
Ow! You shot me!
An evil petting zoo?
In due time.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
You didn't...
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
Really?
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Nature ...
People, too.
How curious ...
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
I resign.
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
An unholy trinity ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
The result would be ...
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
I was about to throw in the towel.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
No thanks.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
I must say, you look more your old self --
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Is that what you think?
Do you always drive this fast?
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
I told Mother I took care of you.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
Trubshaw again? What now?
I'll be back ...
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
You don't believe him?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Makes two of us.
I was getting to it.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Oh, hello ...
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
Are you alright, young man?
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
All right!
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Seventy-five hundred.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Hello?
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Nice shot.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
God, you're a slob.
What are we having?
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
That feels so great.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
That's it, prick lips.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
What can I be doing for you?
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
Oops!
I'd love that.
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Under the table!
Right in there, pal.
Hey, you guys...
Reach out and snort someone.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Wash it to the windows?
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
Did you do it for Tim?
You gotta let me finish --
-- He killed people --
It doesn't go like that.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
I like what you've done with the place.
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
Ya love it, probie?
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Ready?
...Not now, Brian.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
Huh.
I work for city hall.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Okay.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
Oh Jesus Christ...
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Then who wrote the report?
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
So, you surviving without me?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Fireman shit?
Dad!
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He treats you okay?
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Look, I'm sorry I --
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Shadow.
Didn't think you'd make it.
You don't know him.
Alderman Swayzak.
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
You took the chalice.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
I want 15 on the Mets.
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Keep trying.
He gots to be did.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
Yeah, him.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
What's wrong with him?
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
What do I have to do?
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
That's a great handle.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
Go away, unless you got my money.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
I love you too, Daddy.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
He never showed it.
Nobody told me anything.
How did you know?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Sounds risky to me.
I'm in till the end.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
You okay?
This is the group I was telling you about.
We both lied to him.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
Is that good or bad?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
No.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
How did you get this gig?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Let Myrna finish.
Money and nothing else?
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
I feel a song a comin' on.
So what's up with you?
The good stuff.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Maybe you need to start.
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
I know I won't be your puppet.
Good day to you, young sir.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
Has he sent the challenge yet?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Will we always leave it at this?
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Was he cheated?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Good night, papa.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Yes, he's fine.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
I beg your pardon?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Charming Schuvaloff.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
Yeah, if you've slept.
I don't want to go --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Yeah, right...
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
We're not finished yet --
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Jesus, what happened?
You know it's not like that --
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
Bullshit.
Full clip to the body --
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
What happened to "degrees"?
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
How are you?
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
What I said before --
You're a good soldier, Bill.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Move him.
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
We're in the middle of a murder case --
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
Something wrong?
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Dunbar.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
We're fucked, I know --
What?
I pushed him too hard.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Four --
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Hardy, what are you doing --
We need to talk --
What if I don't want it?
That's not true.
Do I have a choice in this?
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
How?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
He said what?
Pike never confessed.
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Great, great. That's fantastic.
See! The big guy likes it.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
Or are you too scared?
Then do it.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
Well, she... uh...
Yeah.
In so many words, yes.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Really.
Hi. How are you feeling?
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
You're not trying to run away?
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
Jesus Christ.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
You know where the chemicals are?
Did I ever tell you about how...
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Tell me how it happens.
Where are we headed?
I'm sorry.
Oh.
How did you get so many?
How did you know my father?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
You never told me how your parents met.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Was she one of your teachers?
So you never bought any land.
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
What's this?
Say thank you.
What?
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
You can see why it's sensitive?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Sorry. You've lost me...
Right.
No.
When?
I...
He wants a lot of money.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
What?
Fine.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Sometimes which?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
What?
I wasn't saying anything.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
My name's Sophia.
Is the flight full?
How do you want to pay?
I need to uh...
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
The fuck you laughin' at?
You wanna go home?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
God forgive you, for how you done me...
YOU SHUT UP!
Or what? OR WHAT?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
LET ME GO!
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
You take it straight?
Want another?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
What is it?
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
He tapped that.
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
What happened to your face?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Back-up.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Who do you think the Jap is?
What are you doing?
What'd you say?
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Squid?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
Nick!
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
What'd I tell you?
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
Nick --
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
Nick!
Because he knows how to get to our man.
You all right?
Don't give him any more.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
I need your help, Joyce.
And I'm supposed to care?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
I don't remember saying yes.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Might be different in New York.
Keep the change.
One guy do all the damage?
Because I want you to tell me.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
That wasn't our deal.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
What's the point?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
I've done some questionable things.
We have a lot in common.
You could help us.
No.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
What's going on down there?
When?
I think, therefore I am.
Yeah.
I didn't like her.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Well, when do you get paid?
You equipped for random questions?
Okay, but...
I think I have no money.
You want to see my friends?
How old am I?
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
What's that?
You sure?
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Yeah?
Are you for real?
I'd take him to the doctor.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
Do I make you nervous?
I can imagine.
What do people do in the afternoon?
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
This feels stupid.
Uh-huh.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
You know what I think?
Bad?
May I ask a personal question?
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
Well?
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
What?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Know what a turtle is?
Where are your folks?
I'm hungry, J.F.
You look... better.
Twenty.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Bravo!
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
My office.
Well, that depends...
Get out of here!
Where are we going?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Right.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
And that's it?
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Hey, what are you doing?!
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
Thank-Q!
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Very funny, smart ass.
Thank you.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
Because I want to get married.
I didn't know that.
One who's not a mutant.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Could we talk about that a little later?
Never drive again!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Where's he gone?
May I please be excused?
The what?
What about her?
Okay. I like that.
You wanted to see me!
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I don't blame you!
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
I've got to go, now.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
What's baseball?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
You have very nice ceilings.
Not particularly.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Who use to own it?
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
You bet!
Does that work?
You dial nine to get out.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Sure.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
Dad!
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
We have to go.
Well, where are you --
Oh, my God!
All back East.
He drank it hot?
No.  They all do.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
To go up.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
You have tranquilizers?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Watch this!
Hi, honey!
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes, yes it is!
Yes.
We stay down here.
Yes.
So where is your roommate, the model?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Give me your hand.
I don't know.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
To bed?
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
What?
What?!!
Gay.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Adam!!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Wolf One -- say intentions.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
What color is it?
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Is Sandy part of this?
Who knows you have these?
You're all through with this now?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
That oughta do it.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Do you like that?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
I liked being with you last night.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Yes.
Yes. Frank--
Do you like my body?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
You what?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Dorothy. No!
Hello, baby.
Hello, daddy.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
No thanks.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Yeah?
God, you scared me.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Would you like a piece of cake?
No, you're right.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Yeah, how did you know?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I don't want to cause any trouble.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Yes. I do.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Okay, thanks.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
What's with Mike?
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Who, me? Why should it?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Okay, be careful.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey? Why?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
My father has a gun at home.
Probably not. No. Why?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Fuck you.
I need Il Duce.
There's ways around that.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Chest pocket.  Shit!
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
You think they sold me out? No way.
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
Yeah, well...
Look again for fuck sake!
What?! What are you doin'?
How's Uncle Sibeal?
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Oh, Jesus.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Where the fuck are you going?
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
Who did you kill?
Give the guy a shot.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
He isn't to be touched.
Now, you will receive us.
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
How many bodies, Greenly?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
Promise me boys.
Roc. You okay?
Worst day of my life, man.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
What is it my son?
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
I believe these young men are right.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Just be natural, goddamit.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
He's a nigger.
Continue the joke.
What color hair does he have?
This is he?
It had an alarm.
Loop around real fast.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Dignan, calm down.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Well, then cut it in half.
Yes, they are.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
Which one was that?
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
See, now we've got a plan.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
He went back for his brother.
I have an idea for that.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
I'm not. But there's --
We've got sixteen dollars.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
I want you to look at this.
You could give somebody a concussion.
Dignan. Take it easy.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Yeah. As a girl.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Freeze!
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
You think Applejack knew?
You're living on a sailboat?
How big is it?
Does it float?
What's he in for?
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
You mean a safecracker?
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Did you ever steal a car before?
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Let's not even talk about it.
It's in the driveway.
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Yeah.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Where'd they come from?
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Are you a fag?
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
You stole a Trans-Am.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
How much could you grow? Realistically.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
You really think he'll remember you?
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
What the fuck possessed you?
You can go first, Bob.
How long has he been in there?
What do you mean get back?
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
I'm sorry, Bob.
That's OK.
Do you have your own cell?
How you doing, Bob?
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
What do you mean grammar?
Is he good?
What?
You told me Bourne was dead.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
That's not gonna fly.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
Let's talk about Conklin.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
What?
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Show me again...
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
You know I'm not.
Because you're afraid!
You still should've moved.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
Where --
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I wanted to kill him.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
A Russian?
And you got to him before we could.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
That's a lie!
No... Jason... please...
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
-- who? -- who else is here? --
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Believed what?
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
What do you think? Is he coming in?
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
But... what will you do?
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
He won't come.
Longshanks promised!
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Wallace has sacked York!
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
What is it?!
No, M'lord.
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
When will his trial be?
I'll wait... back there.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
You know it's a trap.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
They're coming!
Wanna stay with me tonight?
Good to see you again.
Where is my son?
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
Treason. Against whom?
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
Tonight then.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
Peace is made is such ways.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
No dances, just tell me.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
You're. Acting. Like your father.
How. Did you. Know that?
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Dad lives here?
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
Books?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
Are you stupid or what?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
I deserve a lot worse.
Not if you remember my dad.
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
I just thought you should know.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
Then you think it might have worked out?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
It didn't feel like a dream.
Can... can... Can I have this?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
What the hell are you doing?
Just get out, didja?
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Lenny? Come on!
Here you go, buddy.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
So you decided to go to America.
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Yes, I come.
Here's to you, sir.
Hello, Rick.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
And Mademoiselle?
There are only two other alternatives for him.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
Not an easy day to forget.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
How did you get in?
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Goodnight.
What happened with Rick?
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Did he give any reason?
Are you ready Ilsa?
Well then, perhaps you also ---
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
I beg your pardon?
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
But we made a deal.
Everything in order?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
For the time being.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Ho, diplomatist!
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Victor Laszlo.
This is the end of the chase.
Is that a serious offer?
Oh, how do you do?
Oh, no, Rick never --
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Get me the Radio Tower!
He'll double what I pay you.
Boss!
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
You ever going to bed?
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
Get water!
You're beautiful.  Marry me.
Jesus.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
You know, for when you travel.
There isn't any us.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
If I'd known you were alive --
What's that, written on the sail?
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
You okay?
What will you do?
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
What happened to your pants?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
You fucked us over.
That's why you're a gambling man.
How about we go somewhere else?
Permission to come aboard, sir.
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
Why not?
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
What are you going to tell the little ones?
How many months are you?
I've never seen a lobster.
Oh...
But you looked as if you liked it.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
And what did she die of, exactly?
What's the *medical* explanation?
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
Do you think she'll be all right?
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
There! You said it was boring.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
That's a heavy sedation.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
Is *your* father dead?
*Liver* killed him?
But did you know him?
Did you know your mother better?
What's a nanny do?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
What kind of plane are you flying?
Liberator...
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
First pregnancy?
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
What's that?
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
Do you like to read?
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Where do you think you're going?
So, what do you do?
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
We had to finalize the deal.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Nice.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
You're a superstitious fucker.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Ten is standard, sir.
Who's that?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Jake...
Moonan. Here. Shit...
What? I can feel you looking at me.
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
How much?
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Look at you, you skinny prick.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Sorry, I --
What -- What do we do?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
Uh... Everything okay?
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Why?
Uh...
Is it all fugasi?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
What happened?
Pretty much.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Can't say.
Just a tip.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Special Agent?
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
It's just insurance.
What are you doing?
I hate cheats.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
Last hand.
Where did you get it?
I had training. In the Republic.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
How did it go?
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
You're my conscience.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
It's beautiful. Thank you.
What?
Really?
How did you know I was here?
Here...use a spoon.
Great.
No.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
So how are you doing, dad?
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
How did you hurt your hand?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
And I thought you were only after my body.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Would you like a drink?
How are you?
Did you solve your problems?
Detective Inspector Ross.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
Hey Jack, join us.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Where's the magnet?
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
What was that, I didn't hear...
Fuck that shit.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Do you remember the detonation time?
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
This is fun.
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Commander Powell would have named it.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Why would I be pissed?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
What makes you cry?
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
I was expecting someone else.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
I already don't like the sound of this.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
I'm sorry.
Well, not me personally.
What's this?
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
With your help.
Look, I don't know what you want--
Thank you.
Morning, Sunshine...
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Yeah.
A little what?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
A long time.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
So are dogs.
Not right now.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
And she bought that?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
A toy?
What happens if you level with her?
She tells you how I've been--
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
I-I c-can't...
Jeremiah?
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
What the fuck!
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
I think we should try sneaking in.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Jam, listen up.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
But, mom!
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Well? Continue! Continue!
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
I did?
Hi... what's going on here?
Like a DeLorean.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
I'm not following you.
When can I squeeze one out?
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
How can you do that?
Who is... we?
I want to show you something.
Why do they call you Frank?
How much longer is this gonna last?
So... you just moved here?
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Where are we going?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
Well...
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
What? How long was I asleep?
Will you please talk to me?
Did you call the cops?
What?
You're such a fuck-ass.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
Oh, shit!
Who is Frank?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Cellar door.
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
Follow him where?
What is her name?
I asked you about school.
What else do you think about during school?
Can anyone else see him?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Yes. I went to jail.
Regret.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
What is going to happen?
I can see him right now!
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
I... What can we do?
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
How did this happen?
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Chut up!
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
What is this shit?
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
You're what?!
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Amber? Here.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Amber...
Go on! Get out!
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
You don't know where this is gonna...
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
We was robbed.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
That's enough!
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Have you got a license?
Well - what is he now?
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
What other job you got?
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight...
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
Anything else?
How'm I doing, boss?
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
Give me that again!
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
So that's the one you want to marry.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
You won't be long?
What do you mean?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
Yes.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
Don't!
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
How are you feeling today?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Tell me about it, please!
Have you read it?
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
...Yyes
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
Righteousness for his namesake.
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
Who are they of?
The children! May I see?
The Children. Where are your children
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
...my... home?
You did this for me?
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Very smart indeed.
A dressing bag?
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
But you LOVED her all the same...
I've never LOVED anybody!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
Do you believe I love you?
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
But --
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
How do we know this is the way?
What do you see, Erik?
Would you like us to sing to you?
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
We're just not a very musical nation...
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Why should you care?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Halfdan the Black's here!
Who have you been talking to?
I... I... KILLED her...
SHUT UP!
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
A magic dishcloth.
Well, what else do we do?
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
ROW!
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
I came to find my grandfather.
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
It can't do you any HARM...
Same thing, isn't it?
I know. I know.
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Together we stand!
I can't swim! I can't swim!
It's a tradition.
So did my father and his father before him.
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
KILL! KILL!
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
Ms. Kruczynski?
You rat.
Come up to Boston with me?
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
I'm so excited. Yay!
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Really? Because --
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
My name's Clementine, by the way.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
I'm not a stalker.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
I don't know.
It's pretty.
Ready for another?
You just say. I'm not really --
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
Let's talk about it later.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
I want to know you.
There's this guy!
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
I'm sure, I said.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
Well, you're married.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Bye, Joel.
A bully? Moi?
What took you so long?
Yeah?
That's me.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Hey.
I know what it is.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
Mary...
Thanks.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Oh, hi.
It's an apartment.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
That's Jellybean!
No, I guess not.
What do you think?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
What are you doing?
For magazines?
But Countess...
Ballast.
Will it work?
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
Is that an offer?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
What is it?
Do you hear it? Right there.
Please... kill...
What's happening...?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
What does?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
This is Weir.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
I can see that, what're they for?
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
Any survivors?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
You can't leave. She won't let you.
What are you talking about?
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
We've got some weather.
Captain Miller...
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Sir.
Smith, get out of there...
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
Who?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
Go ahead.
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
What?
Weir can't be alive.
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
He served on the Goliath.
Claire...
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Can you see a body?
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Where is she?
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
How'd you know it was me?
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I mean...
He didn't.
Where is Reed?
What did you wish for, honey?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Are you alright?
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
It's about to be a broken face.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
He's not responsive --
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Apparently I can disappear.
I'm driving.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
That's good. That's uh... good.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
What are you doing?
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
I can... make it work.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
But I'm not done with the machine --
It's just business.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
Hi, Brad.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Is everything okay at work?
You are a virgin!
Does Mom know you have company?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Pick a suit.
Are you really a virgin?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Take that back.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
It's definitely your mama.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Damone, are you there?
Well, I've gotta be running.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Are you Linda Barrett?
Not if you're over sixteen.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Are you going to ride that wave?
My brother is gonna shit.
How's it going.
You'll always remember your first time.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
What do you think?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
It couldn't be.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Where's Doug?
Not coming? What happened?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
No. That's okay.
I don't know.
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Naked!?
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
...and we're chock full of that!
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
Can we make it?
I want to leave fast.
When does this thing stop?
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
Lucy.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
Like big lizards.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Extract of pineal!
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
The airport is over there!
You'd pay me for that?
May I see your license.
Could I have that, please?
You realize...
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
I will not die because of him!
You know where it is?
IS IT CLEAR?!
I don't think you should...
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
Oh!
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
And that's how I ended up here.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
You all sure about this?
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Come on!
Why do you take shit from him?
Your parents of relation?
I'm in.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
Oh, no.
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
What?
Nine?
Keys.
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Bullshit.
Got 'cha!
COME ON!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Let's move.
What's wrong?
Okay, well that's something.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Excuse me, sir?
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
You know what I mean.
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
Madam...?
Okay, but come here first.
Hello, Harold.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
Were you an alcoholic?
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
I know that, Dad, but --
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
Age?
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Whattaya mean?
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
How ya doin', Farmer?
Oh no...
Jesus.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
I should've known...
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
You know something, Harry?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
And no people.
Where you goin'?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
How's it sound?
Mama...
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
I don't care.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
What?
Say you promise.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
Where are you going?
Oh, just leave those things for now.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Oh! Are you really?
...Did you really say that?
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
Nice.
Kill you? Hardly that.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
I should go. I should leave today.
Are you all right?
This feels... incestuous.
You make me weak.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
I am not mad.
Do you really think I'm mad?
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
They'll hang him all the same.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
Quite a place.
What happened up there?
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
I have always loved him.
Paracelsus?
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
I heard.
Next Friday.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Help you clean up?
It sounded like Brenda.
Jack?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
I wouldn't know.
What the hell?
Give me a hand?
Thanks.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
Roll him over!
You just had some lucky shots.
Ha!
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
Don't call him.
Looks like a storm.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Mmmmmmmph?
Best over...
You okay?
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
How much do I owe you?
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Good luck.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Twenty-eight.
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Died instantly?
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Now, is your shit together?
You too, preacher?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
What's this stuff?
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
What do you think Mom would say?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
What?
Mexico.
Creepy guy.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
How many bullets left, kid?
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
-- see this, television!
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Not even for lunch?
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
Whiskey!
What dya mean?
What the fuck is wrong with you --
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
That's what you think?
You know what you look like?
My shit is together.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Got it.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
None at this time, sir.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Then good night.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Fine by me, sir!
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
You don't know that.
Come on, Montgomery...
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Chances of recovery?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
So dump on me.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
Who is it?
You really came back for more?  Of this?
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
Clear.
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Where's Audrey?
I like that image.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
Don't you think we have enough?
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
What are you doing here?
Wish me luck!
Can I use some?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Really? A girlfriend then?
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
And how should we do that, Sir?
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
Do I know you?
It's the French Secret Service.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
I need you to trust me.
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
What's with the chewing gum?
I think we should leave now.
What'd they say?
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
About this much.
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
Oh.  Okay.
Brandon.
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
How did you come to that conclusion?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
Systems register functional.
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
Hi everybody.
~e're alive!
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
Hey... Hey where are you going?
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
Are they behind us?
Can it be repaired?
How does the rolling help, actually?
Clenched jaw...
Thank God. Are you okay?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
never doubted you for a second.
You're kidding. When for?
You should have let me hit him.
You know, that's really getting annoying.
Wait. What did you say?
I... certainly, but-
Theramin.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Weapons storage...
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Mathesar? What is that?
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Could be this.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Find them.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
Arnold!
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
Yessir.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
They are... friends of Congress.
You think that?
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
Partially...
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
I feel the same, sir.
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Not today.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Where... do those men come from, George?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
What are you doing?
All people have rights!
You hear that?
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
What is this?
I guess still in the locker.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
What about him?
You get the money?
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
You gave him the money?
What's this movie you're doing first?
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
You know how to write one of these?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
She's great. Gimme the money.
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
The airport.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Sovereign.
Get in line, bro.
You're an investor, is that it?
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
That's what I'm doing.
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
I want you to.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
Part of it, yeah.
What does that mean?
Ever shot anybody.
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal - this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer -
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Here's your keys, Harry.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
It was in the Herald.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
How about this?
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Whatta you think, Chill?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
Rough day on the set?
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Then you've read it?
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
Why not?
I'll be right back.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
Hello, Doris.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Oh, for Christ's sake -
Lufkin. His... agent.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
You think the extra strain caused it?
How about now?
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
Let's not be too hasty.
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Try Wednesday.
Get up.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
Mother fucker!
I thought you said it was just a blade.
But how long?
How long?
Went aboard.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
The radio!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
You're late.
Don't fall asleep.
What's slow?
Headache, nausea, lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
Why not call for help?
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Hey.
The what?
What, like some kind of ghost?
Over the gold.
Greer to Murphy.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
Yeah.
Too deep to anchor out there.
It's funny.
Murphy, goddamit.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Morning.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Pretty low all around.
How're you feeling?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
Say what?
He took the shotgun and a light.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Give up?
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Pumpkin, are you in there?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
Hmm.
...wow...
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Aren't there a million places like this?
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
No.
Hi... what's up?
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
God, what a bunch of retards...
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
Shut up!
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
I might actually get the pasta special.
You're better at it.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Look, maybe that's him!
I want to "make love" to him.
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
Are you sure?
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
What? How long have you been standing there?
We still have to go in there sometime.
What was that all about?
I totally, totally hate you.
You won't believe it! Guess!
But those are our people...
You're gross.  See that guy?
He gives me a total boner!
You're just jealous.
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Hello?
What happened to Seymour?
How repulsive!
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
Hello?
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Do you want anything?
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
May I ask what you're doing?
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Go die, asshole!
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Wow!
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
Jesus...
What is that?
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Uh... hello?
Oh, hi...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
What's up?
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
What do we have here, Margaret?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
What are you talking about?
Thank you, doctor.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
I am a man of peace.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
That's a terrible idea-
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
Anything special about them?
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
We need to talk.
Have you got it?
...misfire... it jammed...
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
Oh yes, I think so.
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Oh no.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
That's a terrible thing to say.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Well, good night, Louis.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
I command you.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
You've got to do something!
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Is the line sinking?
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Who?
What's that?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
What kind of tests?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
What happened?
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
Ready?
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
Are you all right?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
You're quite a housekeeper.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
Don't scream.
Great rehearsal.
Can't you tell me now?
You must have gotten the last copy.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Can I help you?
Great!  How's it going?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
May I please see the storage facility?
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
Circle?
Nervous?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Don't cross the beams.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Where's the Keymaster?
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Sorry, Buddy!
I've got to sleep.
What happened??!!!?
What do you mean by "seen?"
I don't know.  Talk to it.
You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
So do I.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
How do you know?
Who was the architect?
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Do you believe in God?
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Stantz?  You okay in there?
Don't you think you should at least wave?
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
Where have you been?
What is that... wailing?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Caesar, ignore them.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
What the hell was all that about?
You brought the army into Rome.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
He's very realistic.
This is our oil from our estates?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Where is the car?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
But could you try?
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
We won't. Let's go inside.
What is the matter?
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Did they ever find out?
Yes.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
You mean the one who --
Elaine --
I'm meeting someone.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
Yes.
What?
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
I said I think it is.
Well, I want you to leave.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Please let me go.
Don't tell me --
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
What are you going to do now?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
Benjamin?
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
You really will?
Why wouldn't it?
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Ben!
Ben.
Are you listening?
Could I make one phone call first?
BENJAMIN?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
I'd rather not.
Hello.
Give me an hour.
Where is your luggage?
Is it a girl?
In general.
Thank you.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Did you know that?
Sit down, Benjamin.
What do you think?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
Her portrait?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
Don't be nervous.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Hello, Benjamin.
How are you?
He didn't see me.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want to get it now?
Yes.
I got a single room.
Yes?
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Yes?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Wood or wire? They have both.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
On your first time --
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Can I take off my clothes now?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
Him?
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
We're talking.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
How many times a year.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
What?
Why did you do that?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Really. I want to know.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Good.
I have my reasons.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
Well, I'm not.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
But it's not.
This is absurd.
Drive down the block.
I say I've got it.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
When did you two talk this over?
Why?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Now look -- please --
But why?
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Hello.
Yes?
Yes?
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
The Carlsons' are here.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Time's getting short.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
No -- no -- no -- no...
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I'll pay you back.
I have an idea working in my head...
Reducing?
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Why do you look at me like that?
And -- and --
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Strange man...
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
That's a silly joke.
I'll not denounce you.
So --
Do you understand?
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Bless you...
Then you know him?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Is that too much, Baron?
I've no luck.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Hello! Hello! --
For me?
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Any letters?
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Am I!
You...
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
How nice -- your daughters?
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
You're sweet.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
What?
I mean with the Manchester people?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
I know you did -- I said you did --
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Shall I tell them again?
You see -- what we are interested in --
Let us cancel the engagement.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Take them back, Suzette.
Last night?... There was no applause.
You're discharged.
Yes, I know them --
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
No. No word.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
You're a thousand percent right!
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Right in front of the room.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Want a look?
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Yes, yes, but that's --
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
All right.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
They knocked out my tooth!
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
Don't mention it.
I tripped over a chair.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
No.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
I know what's bugging you, of course.
You're getting off the grift?
You heard the shower, didn't you?
I can't. I just left home.
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
Get well soon.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
What?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
What?  What for?
You -- I don't know.
And hello to you, too.
That's natural.
Yes, I know, I know.
Mr. Simms.
Why am I here?
Well, when you put it that way.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
A dead body?
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
No shit?!
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Now you're joking, right?
Why didn't you tell me?
Where are you going?
What?  Where is she?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Better?
You okay?  You seem a little off.
It's John, isn't it?
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Fuckin' A.
Shane's going as a condom.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
He do that to you?
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Where's the baby?!
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
You've created a monster.
No!!!
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Home.
You know what gets me?
At least we found the diamonds.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
You know what gets me?
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
Months?
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Could have happened to anybody.
What's funny about that?
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
Go to the funeral?
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Okay.  Okay.
I know you think that.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
I wanted to apologize.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
Blue soup.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
Gee whiz--
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Anybody home?
Life has denied me that thrill.
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
College!
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
You're supposed to get hurt!
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Play?
A hundred dollars!
What kind of exercise?
Dad?
Mom?
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
You don't even know me.
How do you do?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Bluh.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
Now--turn around, if you would.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
Such as?...
And what is his most cherished possession?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
I'm going to call the police.
I mean it!
How do I load?
But here you are inside, aren't you?
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
She's fine.  Please--
None.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
It died for your sins.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
Hands and knees, you say?
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
You hope.
Cut me open.  Find out.
You're too modest.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
Don't shoot.
Can't do it.
It was a bitch.
And you went home unannounced, too?
How horrible.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Something's made you sore.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
Don't touch me.
No.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
A lot of people don't.
Where will you be?
Then who flushed the toilet?
What's his name?
Everything stays as it is!
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
Yes?
Did you see him?
You were wonderful.
It's true.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
This is very good for us.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
You fool, you fool.
You've got to fight from time to time.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
No. I don't think so.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
Yeah.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
What do you mean?
Now, what do you want?
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Hello. You want some information?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
You making a feature?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
I thought you were going to bed?
Of Joanne's?
Say what?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
They were here?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Why do you say that?
Granville?
What happened?
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Hello?
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Do the police want to arrest me?
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
What is it, Jake?
How's your business, Jake?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Take it or leave it.
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
It's a short film.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
I thought you were a businessman.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Hold it, mister.
Com'on, tell me.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
Granville's looking for you anyway.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
And what are you studying?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Haven't we met before?
Officer, I can explain.
And what do you do, my dear?
How interesting.
What do you want?
Here's your shovel.
Eh, no.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Yes.
But this is my car.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
All right.
All right.
Me! No. Of course not.
What do you think?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You look as if you could.
You don't look eighty.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
Why not?
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Okay?
I think he's following us.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
Did Confucius say that?
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Don't you advance on me.
- end where I began.
Yes.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
Why?
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
I feel giddy.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
"And this too shall pass away."
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
I'm getting married.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
And a lot of time.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
The moment of truth.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
How about to slit his throat?
Parasite!
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
It's different for us.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
No bad dreams.
The box. I need the box.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Get out of the way.
O.K. Let's go.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
I'm scared.
They were over here, Professor.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Don't look! Turn around.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
Got tired of me?
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
-- should go back. Now!
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
Nah, sounds too "needy."
You better have that looked at.
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Out? Out out?
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Just take it slowly.
You fucking ass-holes.
Want to buy a bed?
That your daughter?
Got her mother's looks.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
This isn't for real.
No time for argument.
Nobody escapes us.
Just in time.
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
You're Julia, right?
I'm brother Frank.
There is going to BE a wedding?
Back from where?
I'm hurting
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
This is what began it.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Kirsty.
This afternoon.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
It smells damp.
You're still blaming me.
Larry!
He's here?
How are you doing through there?
What have you done?
You're NOT going to faint.
What's wrong with you?
Plain soda?
Well, isn't it?
No, not much.
No personal details?
First time for everything.
Who's there?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
Well I want you to see the house.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Big house.
Kirsty.
Yeah.
I guess.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
Get the fuck out of here.
I won't be able to stand.
You know I do know the way home.
All right.  No. That's nice.
I see.
Oh no?
If I make it through the day.
Are you busy after work ?
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
What are you doing?
Yeah.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
We can take your car.
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
My band.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
What's up?
Fuck off, Barry.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
That's what I said.
He's got one!
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Uh.  That's me.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Hey Charlie.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Huh?
Good weekend?
Let's not.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
What is this.
Laura?  Are you okay?
Can I help you?
What needs sorting out?
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Hi.
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
What were the others?
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
Yeah.  Great.
It sounds stupid.
Never?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Are you still in love with me?
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
I'm sorry.
Me?
Look, are you coming or not?
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
When are you going back?
What?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
You know, with Ray...
Look, we can do other things.
Mission accomplished.
What it was like.
You know the difference.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Don't you like that?
You share a place with T-Bone?
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
I'll call you.
Yeah?
Hi, Mom.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
I knew this was going to happen.
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
I think you have more.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
I warned you.
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Huh?
You're very macabre.
Happy birthday.
He was unsual.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
No.
Would you remember his name?
-Okay okay.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He was innocent.
No.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
What's all that?
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
I hope I never get that old.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it you want?
What's wrong?
All fashionably without heads.
I want Taupin.
-Et lux perpetua-
Afternoon.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
It is as you are.
Why does he want to kill me?
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Something pretty.
You're wrong.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Your name?
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
We must talk.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Do not turn your back on me.
Yeah.
Are you sure?
How are you?
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
He found us even there.
Run!
This your present address?
Do you know what this is?
Home.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
Are you back?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Too hot?
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Hildy! Where's mother?
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Anything the matter?
How long would the interview take?
I'm beginning to realize that.
Well, she'll know some day.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
Hello, Hildy!
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Afraid? I should say not!
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
You said it.
Now you're talking!
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Don't open that!
How was that for a tight squeeze?
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
Where'd you wire him?
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
What!
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
There's money in it, Cooley.
How much?
Let's see the money.
They're always after me for interviews.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Hey!
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
Hold the phone!
What a chase!
How's everything, Gus?
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
That's murder!
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
Where is he?
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Pete, you're through!
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Pure politics!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
We'll fix that, too.
Shoot to kill, I said.
That's a lie!!
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
You fight it cut.
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Kings and sixes.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Mother!
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Don't forget about production for use.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Don't talk too loud.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Hey --
Are you all right, now?
What's from the Governor?
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
The City Sealer's office!
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
Is it hard?
Get out of here!
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
Look out!
What's your hurry?
Baldwin -- his name is.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
That was a googly!
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
What are you doing here? This is our territory
I know a secret.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
But Dad, It's the News.
It was great for me, how was it for you.
Where?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
What about it?
Why not?
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
How's your war, Mac?
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
Here's to music. And absent friends.
No Turks.
Has Sue got it right?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
You're having me on, Molly.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Drink up, it's party time.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
How much further?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
What?
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
What's this?
No, really.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
What was that?
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Almost there.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Why are we stopping?
Hey, he moved.
Forget it. I'll just go.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
And...
Is that all... think real hard.
Fuck your grandmother.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Huh?
So.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Thank you.
Don't even say it.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
How long has it been?
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
Just back up.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
This is way too fucked up for words.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Where's Bill?
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Well hello, officer.
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
We gotta break it open.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
What about the body you found?
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Wydell.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
And?
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Oui.
Shall we close up, then?
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
I am sleepy.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Well?
Please. I look a mess.
Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
My apologies, madam.
That's what I'm counting on.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Yeah?
No. I married a midget.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
It looks wonderful.
I'm sorry?
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Flares?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
It's perfect!
Who is it?
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
It would just be helpful to know.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
Really?
How's work?
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Ugnh.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
Mother?
Pittsburgh?
Comin' in or goin' out?
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
And a fact is a fact.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
You bastard.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
How much do I owe you?
Poker's not your game.
Pool.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
For me.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Man named Turk Baker?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Thinking about what?
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
What's the matter? What happened?
Sure.
How do we stand?
When do I raise the bet?
I'll beat him the next game.
Tell her what?
Well, here it's half.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Fifty per cent?
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
How much we got?
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
No, no more for me.
Findley.
You gentlemen care for a drink?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Yeah. You must come again.
Hi.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Have a nice trip?
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
What did all this stuff cost you?
Oh, cut my finger.
Do you want me to go?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Oh, grow up.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Now and then. You know how it is.
I hear you've been looking for me.
That's what the game's all about.
I came to play pool, Fats.
You name it.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
Do you remember where you lived?
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
Who is this?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
What do you want?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Only got one kind.
So, what do you do?
You built things.
What's that, Dad?
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I'm home now.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
Mr. Gardner, I --
Why?
Where, Jimmy?
I swear it was here.
Did you call the State Police?
No one comes here after dark.
George, where have you been?
I have school.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
What do you want?
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
You're being paranoid.
David? How'd you get this number?
What do you want me to do?
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
Love was never our problem.
You saved a lot of lives.
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
Then what?
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
Spunky?
This I can see.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
How're we doing?
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
That's impossible...
This is ridiculous.
He's trying to impress you.
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
You're late.
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
Dick-weed.
Your son.
So, what do you do for a living?
Oh. Sorry.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
Stop it.
They let you out?
How' he doing?
Mr. President?
Call them back.
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Yes.
Marcus!  I did it!
All my life!
That doesn't look much like a library.
Look what you did!
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Are you expected?
Tapestries?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
DONOVAN!
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
It must be one of these...
My room!
Knock it off. You're not mad.
Dad!
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
I ought to tell you something.
Come on, Dad. Come on!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Marcus would agree with me.
What did you get?
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
Those people are trying to kill us!
Dad?
The penitent man is humble before God.
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
Why are you trying to kill us?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
And why were you trying to kill me?
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
Interested in local curios?
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Who?
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
Come one, what's wrong?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Let up on the brake!
Give me the stones!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
Indy! Help me!
What?!
Don't let it pull you deeper!
What's happening?
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
I'd like to find one of those myself.
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
Primitive sexual practices?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
It's okay. You're all right now.
What?
I can't!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
Figures...
Give me your hat...
Try me.
Who?
You're in my head...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
Who are you?
Yeah...Who?
You've heard of the PEM114...
Are you threatening me?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Of course you do!
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
I'll tell you what to say.
What's that?
Did you hear that?
It can't take that long.
JOE Or what?
I did. I brought you back here.
I don't like the sound of that.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
...and a license to kill...
It's just not enough.
Now what?
The beach?
Holy shit!
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Now what?
Eat it?
.
Touch her.
Where are you going?
It worked.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Much too blue.
I feel like an idiot.
They're all in it.
Voice stress analyzer.
It's embarrassing.
What Happened?
You been had. We have.
Bingo.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
Where are you going?
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
...drink it.
Ow!
He was with Gruner!
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
I don't trust her.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
Do it.
Are you alright?
Holy...
Gimme a minute.
I have been... I think you're right.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
You're a lucky man.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
JOE What abilities...?
Doesn't matter.
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
Nice?
I knew you were trouble.
What happened?
Impossible.
PEM115!
Surveillance Cameras?
Sir?
Well...
Why would we want to hurt you?
Who?
Was quite excited, when he came in...
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
What do you want?
What?
Then who did?
Oh...and who is it!?
Is someone else here?
...Blake
I'll be right there.
Let you leave without it.
As if your mind's not all there.
Trans Ocean Travel.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Why did you leave?
Why?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
We're very close.
You don't believe me.
How?
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
How?
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
This the only spare?
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
I'll take some.
Mom.
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
So, what are you going to do?
You're taking "no" for an answer?
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
That computer has everything...
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
Hey, Lowell.
Is there any more rice...?
I don't understand.
What's going on?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
No classes this morning?
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Oh, my God.
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Yeah, I'm here.
Yeah.
No shit.
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
I disappeared on you?
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
How do you like your coffee? Black?
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
How much would I get paid?
Should I just take the documents now?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
Hello. You there
Next to your father?
Why?
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
You attract a crowd.
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
I told the truth!
That's not the point.
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
You manipulated me into this...!
You greased the rails!
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
Did he hear you?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
What do you mean there is no family?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
Most certainly.
"I would bet on it."
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Object!
Is that a threat?
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
You're in a rush.
That's his lawyer.
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
What the hell is Botox?
Why in God's name would I want...?
It was a gift from a client.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
I begged you to have a baby!
How nice.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Screw you, asswipe!
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Is that you?
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
You do?
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Honey, I could sit...
Hi.
I have a surprise for you.
Comfy!
I want to nail you ass.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Hello?
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Murder!
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
I was devastated. Of course.
He never even asked. He just assumed --
So. Now what?
Wow.
Do you know him?
Lilly's up.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
Is this Ming?
So what?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
What?!
My client has ruled that out.
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Where does that leave us?
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
And she has...?
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
OhMary
How is she?
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Oh, come now
Ridiculous!
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
If you really mean it, I will.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
What happened?
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.
No. I'd rather you didn't.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
My ticket?
Now, just a minuteyou can't
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Your ego is colossal.
Who are you?
High time you got back.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
It takes money to buy food.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
Not a one.
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
What are you thinking about?
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Carrots.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Eight o'clock tonight.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Yesif he is your husband.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?
The old man's screwy!
What's up?
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Who's she gonna marry?
You send telegrams here?
Mush. Mush.
There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Thenyou'll have to git !
Not a minute!
What's the idea?
Wife?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Sh-sh-sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Recall any names?
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Who?
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
Can you get some sworn statements?
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
It leads farther than that.
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
What about Ruby?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Dad, look what I drew.
Are we going away, Daddy?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
Who?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Get a hold of yourself.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
For sexual purposes?
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
What's wrong, Lou?
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
Are they?  Why would they?
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Do you walk home?
What are they?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
Won't forget?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
What's the problem?
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Great, you're here.
What's going on?
She sound scared?
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
My pocketbook.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
You don't want much, do you?
How was your flight?
You know who put the dope in your bag?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
He came by.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
How do you feel about getting old?
How'd you feel about it?
Well, hello.
Catching a movie.
And Annette's it for you?
Who was your girl before Annette?
You think he's got a thing for you?
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
He tries to act cool.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
You do that?
Did you do it that night?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Where's the rest of it?
Then you're out and you get nothing.
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
That's Ordell's.
Who's side are you on?
If I don't cooperate?
He say is a surprise.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
We'll just be a minute.
You know what we want.
How can you help us?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
She didn't say.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
You didn't count it?
Uh-huh.
That would be one point of view.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
There was a guy with Melanie?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Uh-uh.
You already knew that?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
It looks good on you.
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
And what was your answer?
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
The Cockatoo Inn.
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
How the fuck they know that?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
I don't know. One of your friends.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Want a hit?
How long?
Four years?
Want a Metrix?
You're fourteen years old here?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Lemme have the bag.
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
Whatcha watchin'?
I didn't look like a bum.
What's your relationship?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Couldn't talk to her?
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Then what?
What'd you shoot her with?
Jesus Christ.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Yeah.
Getting there.
Comfortable?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
You know who this is?
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Who is it?
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
Hello.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Hey, wait!
Daddy, what was that noise?
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
What do you mean, demons?
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
I saw Sarah the other day.
Louis, you're a life saver.
Jake, you need to rest.
Are you in the service?
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
That help?
The room!
What happened to you?
Did you look around the headboard?
Who? Jed?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
And look what I got.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
Is that the one who died?
Ready?
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
He said you didn't have one.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Who was that?
How?
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
I don't know you.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Oh God!
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
You come here often?
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
Clear the area. This is an order!
We're doing everything we can.
Speaking.
Still married, Jake?
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
A car accident.
Do you want me to get someone?
I have some ice from the machine.
I don't have all day, kid.
What's that?
Minimal.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Can't shut em' down from here.
Uh-oh.
Okay that hurt.
Where have you been?!!
Nice touch.
Everyone okay?
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
Boeman, the ships not here.
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Jesus, God!
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Where is everybody? What happened?
Give me a break! What happened?
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Pull me in!
Where are you going?
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
It's time.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Kaboom.
Push off toward us.
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
Close the fucking door!
And what's with the headgear?
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
What do we do?!!
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
I don't know...sorry?
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Kay-Em we made it!
I gotta go back.
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Azrael can you repeat that?
You're not going anywhere.
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
My cars. And a comic book.
This is Matt Hooper...
Did you get him in the head?
What about us?
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Love ya.
Home... New York?
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Got a pen on you?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
What's that?
What? What?!
What is all this stuff?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
You all right?
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
Would you like something? Some coffee?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Coming right to us!
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Is that normal?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
We could get back together too.
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Wait, let me take that.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Why?
I try really hard, actually...
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Did you hear it's yours?
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
We don't even have a dog!
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
No.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Why aren't you at work?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Well, it can really only go two ways.
Junk?
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
The Wizard of Gore?
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Cute?
No.
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Can I take your coats?
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Then what's going on?
Is the baby okay?
What...
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Excuse me?
Yeah, she does.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Aha! You love him.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
No way! She's pretty.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
What do you make with that?
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
What did you do?
Have you found a place to stay?
A hotel?
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Happy birthday Adele.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
What if they're dangerous?
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
...thank you.
What's wrong with her?
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
Henry Lucas.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Sure.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Who said he's my good buddy?
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
...never?
...You know what I mean?
...Janitor's job.
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
How old you?
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
Oh man, that's the best.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Telly.
You thirsty?
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
That.
Yeah. Why you give money.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Nah.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
You goin'?
I'm goin'. You on the list?
You sure?
Man we fucked him up.
Sup. Sup.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Uh huh.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
Telly is at Steven's?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Sorry.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
The pain. The fucking pain!
You didn't?
Like where are your erogenous zones?
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Yep.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
Yep.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Hello?
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
What man? What is it?
By yourself?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
No.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
He's not talking about himself.
You're a lying bastard!
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
You think he's dirty?
How is she?
You alright?
A few people.
To get your attention.
Why her?
Just like who?
What makes you think I was there?
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
It's me you want.  Not her.
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
What's this?
You might not have done it had you known.
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
Feeling better?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
You must be Erica.
I know he really likes you.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
Anything?
You mean, no prints but hers?
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
Well?
Kathy?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
Where were you last night?
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
It's a good play, but risky.
About what?
Feel like practicing?
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
That's a very personal question.
You.
Well, I think I've had enough.
Why?
I'm hungry.
Fine.
Did you call?
Peter...
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
Why?
How did you know it was "carefully"?
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
I'm not nervous.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
We're almost married.
I lied.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Lyssa ...
That's a better one.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
You have not slept in two days.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
Yes.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
She must make a glaive.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
Each to his fate.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
Well, I'm not impressed.
My heart stays here.
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
I'm hungry.
And do you think I live on air?
One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
It's a lie!
He will come for me.
What news from our friends?
Freylag's stronghold?
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
A fine match.
Can you see?
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
She has the power of vision.
Few have survived it.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
Look.
But you would not stay with me.
Knowledge.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
No, no.
Take...
OK, I'm fine.
Rocket launcher.
Wow! It's brilliant!
Good! First shot!
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
Mathilda? May I come in?
May I go to the cinema?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
When I say I love you.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
How many girlfriends did you have?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Don't fear.
...Composer.
But... He works for your same employer?
Is he still alive?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
Here comes the resume.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
I have to finish first.
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
So what's the deal Maurice?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
It's a special day isn't it?
What it is -- is the truth.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
There's no reason.
I want children.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
Your father?
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
From where?
Why?
Most certainly.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
Where?
I'm walking there Kris.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
What's your shoe size?
Orange soda?
Water?
Hello!
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
What's up?
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Ben?
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
Your color.
Please!
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
I like it here with you.
I wanted to see you...
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
You have been lonely?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
A full night on the street and this is all?
Yes? What?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Why would I kill my husband?
What's going on?
Did you hear a shot fired?
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
How many, would you say?
I'm sorry, but --
You're not going up there.
I do. I'm not allowing it.
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
What's going on?
Why didn't you call me?
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
It's not my alibi to tell --
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
Picking out my wedding dress!
Josh proposed!
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Why?
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
How can you still believe she's innocent?
And you know this for a fact?
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
What the hell is that for?
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
What're you doing here?!
It's pink.
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
You're beautiful.
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
Of course.
And I fully support that.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
C'mon. Let me take you home.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
Now I am.
Hovering?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
You go?  Not watch fun?
What?
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
You go to lady now?
Your love.
And you... are you not also afraid?
Protection?
No more... please...
You're a beast!
What was that?  Did you hear that?
Might we watch, too?
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
You come stealee tleasoo?
No, wait... please... listen...
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
No... I... I need to rest.
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Pregnant, is she?
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
Beware.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Nice piece of work.
God's blessing.
What make ye of that, Jack?
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Can we trust him?
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Well done, lad.
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
How're these?
You promised!
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Where are you going?
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
No!  I won't let it happen...
What?
What's the matter?
Step lively now!
Sigurd's sword...
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
The fastest in the world.
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Uhm... fine work.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Is he a friend, then?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
Are you going to see Sam again?
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
And video games after!
When does George get to come see his house?
Oh.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Red.
Alyssa.
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
I don't know.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
What's the point of this?
I thought I was helping you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
This is such a street of whiners.
Are you guys' friends?
Mr. Stevens?
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
I have the permit.
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Oh.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Is Alyssa home?
I didn't recognize you!
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
You're here early today.
George, this is the third time.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
I'm not going!
I'm not doing it!
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
I don't beg.
Where are you going?
Where is it?
You can't make me do a thing.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
That's not true.
I know parts of who you are.
I gave up on you.
Sun glasses?
Why wouldn't she leave?
After everything.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
And you told Mom today?
I aimed high.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
Because Dad left?
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
I need to talk to you.
I was parked in day parking.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
The garage.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
One of you would end up dead.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
It's not breakfast yet.
Finished or unfinished?
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
You brought your kids?
Do you need help?
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
It sounded like a pick-up line.
Let's not do this, okay?
Don't move!
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
To shave your chest?
The biggest waste of time since television.
After the kids are back in school.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
Do you know anything about building a house?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
These are free papers.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Engagement ring!
Can't you remember your own name?
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
How would I get a loan, anyway?
You're soft.
I said you're soft.
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
You lost all our money in a card game?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
You know what I'm saying.
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
What does that mean?
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Crawfords.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
Crop duster.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
Well, if that's the way it is...
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
What?!
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Back to New York for starters.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
You sure it was him?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
He's from New York City. That one, too.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Where am I at, man?
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Apparently, your sister died.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
I'm interested. Keep talking.
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
That's what I thought!
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Hello, Cassius.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
I'll call her later.
She goes to Parson's, right?
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
How come you're not older?
Valerie's crying!
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
This is baloney!
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Knock, knock.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
This is bad, Nicky.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Hey...
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
What's with that guy?
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Schnapps...
Come on. One more time.
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Please. You got to.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Adrian?
You think I'm a tourist?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
You have a dog? What kind?
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
Don't do it.
Off limits.
Why is that funny?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
Hey...
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
I'm a Sandman!
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
Answer the question!
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
You missed something special.
That was a great shot you made.
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
Where do you live, Mary?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
You felt sad. What's your name?
Later.
And now?
I'm not armed.  Well?
Maybe... sure...
And then you killed him, right?
Please? What friends?
If you did know, you'd tell me.
They're like beasts. Wild.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
I -- I can't.
Are you taking me to them?
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
What do you suppose this was...?
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
I hate outside! I hate it!
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
What does it mean?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
What people?
How did you get here?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Well? How do you like it?
You're not contagious are you?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
You want somethin'?
I like to remember things my own way.
Do you own a video camera?
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
He'll kill us.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
How'd it happen, Alice?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
You all right?
Where's the bathroom?
Andy, who is that guy?
What night is that?
What's up?
The police called us.
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
Have you made any charges against him?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
We saw you that night, Pete.
Repeat that, Bill.
Did you ask him who he is?
Yeah, Mack?
We know that.
Who is this man?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
That's it.
What's your axe?
What's bothering you, Madison?
What is it?
At your house.
Good book, huh?
From the club. You didn't answer.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Suit yourself, champ.
No. No, I don't.
What are you guys doin'?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
I was?
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Two years!?
Fossils, huh?
A what?
Good morning, Lovey.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
I see.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Yes.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
What are we going to do?
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Think of it! In times like these.
Huh?
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
You mean you don't want to go?
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
And the wine - excellent.
Goodness, no!
Oh, yes.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
I surprise you? Now that's news.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Charming, isn't she?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
You're lying, aren't you?
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
It's astonishing - and incredible, but
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Bob, these are all that are left.
Oh, stop it!
What is it?
Well - I mean
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Uh-huh.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Porters?
George, come back!
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
What's she got to do with it?
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Yes.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
They don't?
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
I wasn't scared...
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
We'll take it from here.
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
what's this?
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Something's wrong here.
Since how long?
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
Would you call this a code 100?
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
What do we do?
What are you doing?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Nowhere.
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
This it?
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Kay?  What's your 20?
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Actually, I don't know...
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Drop some money.
Oh, God...
Please, I want to go back...
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
Just some guy... they found.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
You made those tapes...
That's an old one.  One of our first.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Really?  You've never been inside?
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
You set me up...
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
She was looking right at me.
Just go to the beginning!
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
You're alive?
I forgive you.
Sean, wait...
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
Something wrong?
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
I believe in that system...
You want to bring it down.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
How do I even know which one has it?
Oh, God, what did you do?
This is all my fault.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Precog Deja Vu...
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
I like it.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
I don't have any sugar either.
Since right after we lost our son.
They've never been separated before.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
You sure? I just made it.
Thank you very much, sir.
Women?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
Is he cute?
Oh no. What is it this time.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
Hello.
Oh my god. What happened?
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
No coke tonight.  Right?
I never promised you anything.
Take her.
Whu --
What's his name?
What's that?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Where's Ricky?
This is it.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Yeah. Sure.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Yes.
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Yeah?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Can you check?
How am I being shitty?
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
I like it.
Nice work.
Right here's fine.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
They didn't say an address?
Nothing else.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
What the fuck's going on?
Nothing, man.
Let's do it.
Let's check out the penguins.
What about it?
Calm down.
No. I'll wait here.
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Where's the surprise?
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
What's up, man.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
You look good, man.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Yes.
Excuse me.
No?
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
What do you want?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Good morning.
Nah, man...
Yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of Persians?
Sure. You boys want anything?
That money is your per diem.
What about my keys?
I get it.
No. I'll take a strega.
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
I'll get it.
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
Where can I get a hold of you?
Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
Take it easy, baby.
Man live by his rep.
Man, what do you want?
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
What the hell for, man?
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Where am I gonna start?
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
The body is a holy repository.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Make it plain.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
Could we sit down someplace?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
Let's talk about you for a change.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
I'll be away a lot.
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
Get some sleep.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Let's cancel.
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
You know that gal?
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
You the man.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Well, all right, then.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
[Where are you coming from?]
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[How does it work?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[I don't know, I swear.]
Who's he?
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
Were you provided with a gun?
But don't you stay in El Paso?
How long you staying, Crease?
You did something on impulse?
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
You mean a misfire?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
So you were unhappy?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
You feel sorry for the husband?
So how come you know so much about those countries?
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
Last night. Do you know something?
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
Bye, Mom.
Creasy.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[Who's that?]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
You helped him get this job.
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Who?
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Ah?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
You come up here often?
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
Marty...
No...
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Hello, Ma.
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Tommy!
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
What do you want me to do?
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Don't you use olives?
Miss you, Walt.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
Us. Lead us not into...
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
And there it is.
I think I heard about that.
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
Look.
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
Is he out?
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
For you, Trapper.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
I don't feel anything.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
The bastards outconned us.
What's the matter?
How did you get called that?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
You really say the cutest things.
Yes, Reverend?
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
About that chest-cutter...
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
What's going on? Who started this?
Yes, that's what I mean.
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Can you make out what they're talking about?
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Huh?
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
Oh.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
The Websters!
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
The letter.
The letter from John Doe.
Looks all right
That's our man. He's made to order.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Now listen, Annhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Colonel!
Have you seen him?
Had any schooling?
What do they want?
Who's got him?
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Well, I don't get it.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
What are you doing up here then?
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Yes! I was paid! But the
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started
It's for Ann . . .
She isn't?
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Racket? What do you mean?
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Spencer of the Chronicle .
Is there a crowd in the street?
Floor seats.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
What's the line?
I won't get away with it.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Who's controlling your mind?
Tell me what's wrong.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Manual or automatic?
Hi, Roper.
It's all there.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
What's the point of this?
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
We see each other every couple of months.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
To save lives.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
To run last?
The 6 horse is still last.
Is it always like this?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
Please. I'm begging you.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
You like this place?
Yeah?
Korda escaped.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
...the hell are you talking about?
Stay up there, Girl...
Roper.
Are you going to make this hard for me?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
The car is part of the deal.
I can't do that.
Roper...
What do you need?
There are two million people in there with you.
God-Damn you!
How come I can't remember?
You were right.
Who are you?!
But this is impossible.
What's happening?
It's time to wake up.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
Where the hell are you going?
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
What's her name?
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
Who did he digitize?
Then you had her killed.
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
An interface attendant.
Need the disk back!
Insurance?
Then how do you know about --
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
Why?
I'm sorry.
What's so funny?
It was just there.
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
We've got him locked!
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
Is this... food!
Anybody see anything?
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
That's the only way to the Monolith...
Two thirty three a.m.
I'm in!
It's... an eagle?
... A falcon?
Hey, boss!
But boss, what about their parents?
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
THREE SECONDS!!
You own a hotel, sir?
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
We're asking you to go to prison.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
Same here.
You got something to hide?
I booked passage to London.
Would it be painful for you?
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
Come off it, Bugs.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I'm glad ya come.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Where we headed?
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
We learn from life.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
The Big Picture.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Where's the stiff?
Forget it.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Luciano is dead?
What a cozy little scene.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
DEATH!!
You're really gonna pop the question?
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Bitchin' good cake.
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
Stu?
What's the matter?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Kimmy! What's the matter?
Hypnos?
Is there something else I can do for you?
So, what do you think?
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
How are you doing sweetheart?
He seemed quite taken with you.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Who is it?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
But it *isn't*?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
What dame?
Oh--yeah--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Okay. You don't mind?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
You know, we're getting married.
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
The war's on!
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
One minute! Just one minute!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
*You won't?*
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
I did. What about it?
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Washington!
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Mr. President!
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Will the Senator--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Please, sir!--come with me!
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Oh, now--
Fine--
Certainly would, Joseph.
What is it?
Is--is something the matter?
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
I know. It's--Violet.
You--don't know it, do you?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Sure.
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
What! Who?
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
I know that.
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
What are you talking about? What difference--?
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
How nice.
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Order!
That's going to be fun.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Since he was born.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Oh, yes.
He's still pixilated.
Any children?
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
But they did take place?
And you saw them happen?
Oh, thank you!
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
Tell me more about yourself.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
Sure. I met you.
There's Times Square.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
In a day or so, I think.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Good night.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Huh?
You're a fool, Babe.
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Is that the best you've got?
Sit over there, will you?
He's not home, I tell you!
Thank heaven.
Must we have the echo?
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
I can't find him.
Yes?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Will you have a cigar?
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
That's funny. Why is that?
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Naturally.
Let him alone.
Yes, sir.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Proceed.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Uh-huh.
Who are they?
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
No, sir.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
Yes, sir.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
Why are they ganging up against me?
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
You can go out there if you like...
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
What an asshole!
Thank you.
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
What are you doing for lunch?
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
Why not?
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
I was... never satisfied.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
How long you been in this town?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
...so rich?
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Hello, Lionel.
But you know how to drive?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
How are you?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
Finally, some common sense...
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
What can you tell me about this?
When did you start to feel this way?
No.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
Is that when you split up?
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I guess you saw the show...?
Sofie...
You feel violated?
I am irate!
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
Will you think about it?
...but first, you have to tell me something...
We're only talking about six weeks.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
What are you talking about?
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
She's probably ten years older than you.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Damn! What is your name?
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Sounds like you have several.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
Who the hell are these guys?
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
Now go find me a big stick.
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
My very good friend! What a surprise.
Goin' somewhere?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Where's your new friend?
What just happened?
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
Fifty percent.
No?
Every damn day.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Yes.
You know your history.
Can you swim?
That "thing" gets me excited.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
Why would I do that?
No... Why?... Should I?
Is he supposed to look like that?
Got guts, lady.
Have you no respect for the dead?
Jonathan?
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
You lied to me!
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
Juicy?
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
Who's here!?
That looked rather painful.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
I thought you were done?
You two timing psychotic bastard.
He was the last time I saw him.
Hey, do I look like a Man?
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Snap out of it!
He'll never make it.
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Come here.
Who?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Or talk?
Hi.
I admire you.
I'm going inside.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
I'm liking this.
GET MAD!
I'll drive.
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em!
Or flowers.
Agents?
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
But... only when no one is looking.
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
You guys going to a costume party?
Wow.
Really?
So what can I get you?
Jeffrey!
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
You did?
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
This is bad.
Are you sure he's still lives here?
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Proceed.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
You realize what is at stake?
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
Who is there?
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Bastia -- and you?
I haven't been there for three years.
No, they're living in Nice now.
Ah-hh, no.
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
Why didn't you wake me then?
How did it spread so quickly?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
And he sent you to me?
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Thank you.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
Do you expect me to believe that?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Go away -- I'm busy.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Yes!!
But you will not... be safe...
Who is it?
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
What?
You wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
Can you give me a drink, please?
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
What I am talking about is moderation.
And where do you place Alexander?
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
It's cool, but where's the water?
I know you smoke weed, right?
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
Stretch it out.
It's about to work, just come on.
What's crackin'?
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
You know what this is?
$247.
What's the matter?
Thanks a lot, Craig.
It works.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Yeah, air.
You go first.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
You're welcome, Unc.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Huh?
Next time, page me first.
Delivery!
I don't play for no team.
What is it?
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
Nice neighborhood, huh?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Craig, remember what I told you.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
You see that?
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
What?!  What that mean?
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Tape his mouth shut.
Debo!  Debo!
I can't feel my legs no more.
Hey, what's going on?
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
What about that ugly dog?
My back.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
Where'd you come from?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
I appreciate that.
I remember you...in the elevator.
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Daddy?
What about the gun?
What...?
I kill her - and you kill me.
One thirty. California Ballroom.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
All right. Kisses to you.
No. Kisses to you.
I have to do something.
I said I have to do something.
You remember me?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
Oh, Jesus ...
Keep the change.
Meet Irene.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Hey!
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Get moving.
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
Any trouble?
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
Where's your Mom?
Here they come.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
Just went?
Is he hit pretty bad?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Lynch him! Lynch him!
He lied!
What?
You go set down by the River.
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Pearl! You ain't --
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Don't you hurt her!
Where ye from?
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
What's taking you so long about it?
About our secrets.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
Didn't you have no inkling?
The first night?
Do you want more children, Willa?
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
What's wrong, John?
What do you want?
What are you after them for?
Miz Cooper!
Okay, good. She's asleep.
What the hell's going on!?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Guess I did.
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Jesus, it's dark in here.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
What happens if they don't do that?
What!?
Decide to take a day off after all?
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
She lived there.
Who? Who did that?
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
Right home after.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
Get into bed.
Mother, for petesakes.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
What's with the bars?
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
Give me the key, mother.
I never touched her.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
No.
Rod says the sweetest things.
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
You feel better now, right?
When did you have a nightmare?
Bring me forty-five back.
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
You want this?
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Capitalistic methods...
Misha! Misha!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
What a lovely room you have here.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
The former Duchess!
Good morning, Your Highness.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Good evening, Gaston.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Have you?
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Is this satisfactory?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
We can wait.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
Let's do that.
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrade Kopalski...
How much does this cost?
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
That's two weeks from Thursday...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
You want me to go in there?
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
What for... why?
In other words you don't know.
Why do you need my finger?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Yes, it is.
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Then you don't want me to go there.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
Is that customary?
Don't do it, please.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
I wish they had never met.
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
You see I couldn't shout that.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
How do you do?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Comrades! Comrades!
I must talk to my brothers!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
Would that make you any happier?
What shall we get? The news!
It's dead.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
Hello, Leon!
Oh, Leon!
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
You leave me no choice.
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
Unfortunately.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
May I have your bags, madame?
Good morning, Comrade.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
We could check the tape again, sir.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Is it?
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
Why me?
It's a code or something.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
And?
Pay him.
This is June twentieth?
I don't have a pistol.
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
But what are we paying him for?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
Where are they?
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
What'd you say?
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
Mom expects great things from you ...
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Kissinger?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
We got the press this time!
Of them.
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
Dick, don't...
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
I'll do it.  No more.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Were you planning to tell me?
This.  Above all.
Anything.
Because ... I have to relax.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
Hiding what?
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Some say you are, Rocky.
How fresh is this coffee?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
None of that explains your man though.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
No I ain't.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Yes ma'am, I do.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
But you don't believe it.
We goin' in?
What about yours?
...Now that's aggravating.
What was the bullet?
...This month's checks.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
...Be careful.
Don't hurt no one.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
I put it in, Mama.
I wouldn't worry about it.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
You gave your word?
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Did you buy that gun?
What'd you give for that thing?
Big talk.
Llewelyn.
What're you doin', baby?
Why all the way to Del Rio?
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
What should I do?
Huh? What is...
...You getting anything on this?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
What way would that be?
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
Didn't mean nothin'.
Is somethin' wrong?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
Yes I do.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Tent poles.
One room, one night.
November the 28th, last year.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Yessir.
What do you want to know?
What about one forty-two.
Waitin' for my wife.
...But that won't last.
What did you do?
I don't mean braze.
Are you jackin' with me?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
...plenty
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Oww, the arm, the arm!
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
Great. Good. Content...
You must be joking.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Did you watch it yet?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
So, call me when you --
What was that?
Sure you don't want any salad?
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Yes.
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
You're hurting him!!
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Doctor David Ravell.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
...this is your sweater, right?
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
Relax, we brought the cash.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
It's not here. Let's go.
What the hell was that, another statement?
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
That was a really shitty thing to do.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
I'm not telling.
What doesn't?
I said 'got it?'
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
...and how long did she work here?
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Jesus Christ!
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
Can I have an evil twin?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
What did you say?
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
Her show?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Whuhh...
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Pullin' ah pants down...
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
I counted to three, honey.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Come back here, kid!
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
Great ass.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
When did this happen?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
No, sir!
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
You're good.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
Hi, son.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
What did you call me, Mayo?
Louder!
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
How late?
What other issue is there, Sid?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
You serious about having him over?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
Do you go to school?
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
There's always a choice.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
That was great.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Could you believe those girls!
That isn't true, is it?
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
Sid, what happened?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
What the fuck is funny about this?
Me.  I am.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
Th --
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
Get the fuck away from me.
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
They're not supposed to be here!
Unless Daddy comes back later.
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
They won't get hurt.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Can we come in?
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
That door is a safely hazard.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
No cars.  Feet are faster.
No, Edgar Allen.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Shoulda got an apartment.
What's going on?!
Damn it!
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Tyrone...
No...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
What are you doing with the gun?
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
...Glad you came man.
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Yes sir, I did.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
Did you shoot the officers in question?
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
Huey man I got to talk with you...
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
You were. infantry right?
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Huh?
You got something on your mind... "brother."
You alright?
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
Yeah... cop hit me...
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You believe that?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Am I one of that sort?
Well?
What do you mean, old and ugly?
You don't know him very well, do you?
You look well, Charlotte.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
That is a separate issue.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Do you see that, Colonel?
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
What news?
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Father...
What now, sir?
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
Goodbye, Francis.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
How far away?
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
Who might you be, little Miss?
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Yes, but the rope might be--
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
No-I guess not.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
I don't get it.
Yeah, sure.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
Was it Pascow?
You need a glass?
What were you listening to?
Not yet...how much further is it?
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
It's Church.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Going to tell Ellie?
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
The movers--
My God!
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Thank you, Louis.
I'm going to try to do better.
You better get going, hon.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
You stole my boat.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
How does he do that?
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
Now?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
You have a name, missy?
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Maid or not, it fits you.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
You're speaking up for him again?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
I'm glad we got here in time.
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
You?!
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
A fool's errand.
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
You cheated.
I can get you out of here.
Agreed.
Not without my effects.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
Are you certain this is the right way?
Jack!
No, it's not.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
He may be.
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
She says it's not.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
Then you still love me?
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
Where did he go?
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
I don't believe this is happening...
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
What's it smell like?
Sir, please try to hold still.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Somebody has to.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
Daniel, give him the Trix.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
We don't have time for hysterics.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
That was an egg?
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Look at this!
What's wrong?
That's pretty good.
What's that?
That's going to fit me?
You made this out of my hair?
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
You're not going after Argon!
You!  I remember you!
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
Oh, Mother!
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
What's the idea, Anne?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Look, I quit!
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Yeah, little Gloria.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Why not?
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Well, when are you quitting?
Araby?
Who are you?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
All right, outside!
Yes.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
You what?
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
My error.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
My mistake - she's glaring.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Did who?
What do you know about Conrad?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Traps shut!
Hello, Smith.
I suppose you know why I came?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
But I
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
And they won't be able to tell?
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Having kind of a tough time.
What?
No she's not.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
What?
... Why?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
Don't! Just let go.
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Are you alright?  What is it?
Did you do this?
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
What's outside of Pleasantville?
No, not that hedge. The other one.
Pleasantville Marathon?
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Lemme see that.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
Noooooo!
Oh God.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
Who's that?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Those are my friends.
JENNIFER!
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
So what is it?
No. She really liked you.
Sure ... Where would we go?
What's going on?
Real rain?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Where are they?
You're gonna forget about me.
I like calling you David.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
... Like Prince Charming.
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
How much does it cost?
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
I want a word with you ...
What do you mean?
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
You know what I really like?
Aren't you a little early?
TV repair.
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Oh GOD ...
Hey.
Well, I can't talk though --
Yes, I'll be there.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
...please, I just don't want it....
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
Hello, this is Back.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Hello?
Hi....what....what's up....?
Uh-huh.
Yes.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Hello?
-- you said you did.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Do you want to pick me up?
You like her?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
....yeah....
What happened?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Are you learning how to play it?
Oh that's great.
Yeah.
I don't freak out very often.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
Where you married?
It's so nice.
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
Where do you have to go?
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
Yeah.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your name?
It's ok, take your time.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Who is this?
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
How many sisters do you have?
How you doin' Barry?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
Why you wearin' a suit?
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
What is this?
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Where you been?
I need to talk to you for a second.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
I'm sorry.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
I know.
Ok.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
What did you say?
Yeah.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
Madeleine --
Free his mouth.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
And --?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
They can't be serious.
You mean to take us all down with you?
I have a proposition.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
It's no secret that you loved her.
I saw the longing in your eye --
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
His wife's?
Oh. That.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
He'll do no such thing.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
Surely you've seen a man naked.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
...yes, I've got that bit...
"...your wife."
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
How was I to know, my darling?
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Who are you, sir?
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
How bad is it?
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I just want to understand--
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Keep filming.
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
Magic
Not for me.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Jesus
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
This better be good
Mank-
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
Sorry to disappoint.
It doesn't have to be
I'll hire you  -- right now-
Craig is one syllable
I want you back
I'm sorry.
Did I ever tell you about my father?
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Is that from one of the Gospels?
Shit
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Oh God.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
You're going to destroy it
You talked to New York?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Well it' s all you've got !
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
You know?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Yeah --
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
I did keep an eye...
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
I can't find my ball.
Can you see it?
Now, touch me...  ...here.
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
What'd you see?
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
The kids are sleeping.
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
No, you're his wife.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
I can't do that.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
Did you ever own a saw?
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Something wrong?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
You're never going to marry?
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Keep your mind off her.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Huh?
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
Thank heaven that's over!
I wonder.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
What about the rest?
It is something really important, Jeff?
How's your leg?
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
Don't you ever have any problems?
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
Yeah.
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
I wonder where he's going now?
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
What doesn't?
We have all -- what?
From his landlord -- once a month.
The same.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Where can we meet?
Buzz Gundersen.
Sure.  It's fine.
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Hey--I want to ask you something.
Go ahead.
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Excuse us a minute?
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
Frank!
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
Come back tomorrow.
You shouldn't monkey with him.
You scared?
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
Are you really going to meet them?
What?
Jim!
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Isn't it crazy?
Let's see how long we can stay under.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Plato?
You sure?
Can I keep it?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
'Bye, Mom.
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
It doesn't matter to them.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Why did you do that?
You can trust me, Judy.
You can't talk underwater!
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
What?
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
Is he your friend?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
What?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
How did you know that?
I was talking to Dad.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
He wants the money.
Searching for a money man...
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
You can't find... what?
We sell children's toys --
Negative five?
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
You motherfucker.
Get the hell off of me!
I thought we'd have a few more days.
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
That guy knows you?
I love you, Nick...
They'll have guns.
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
You... you... YOU --
What?
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
But you were saying you were...
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
Be more specific.
You knew the place --
The hell you don't.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
What?
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
So what the hell good are you...
Rather be back in the Mountain?
You do.
You got one hour.
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
NO.
No gun.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
You gotta be kidding me.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Get in the CAR!
Ash?
Ash?
Where the HELL did he go?
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
...so where is he?
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
What about the Powwow Safe?
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
Hell yeah. You work here long?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
What about the money?
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
Monsters in the gelatin...
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Rudy, don't move --
GUARD! GUARD!
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Do what?
Switch seats with me.
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Alone at last.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
Daddy, did ya see that?
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
I gotta memorize all this shit?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Mr. Brown?
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
What happened?
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
Gun shot.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
So, is he dead or what?
So what is it?
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
And this is Helen Carter.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
So am I.
They're stragglin'.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
Tell me, darling.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
All my clothes --
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
I can't --
How does she draw?
That's right.
Who's Lednov?
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
In a fight?
At the ranch maybe?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
You're not bein' quite fair.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
You got no business snoopin' around --
What is it?
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Suppose I take a look.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
How far up the trail?
What are you doin' --
Would you like to learn them?
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Then I know my alphabet.
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
What do they look like?
How about California?
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
She was only teasin'.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
Goodnight.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
I found a picture of his wife.
Me, too. 101?
My favorite memory was when we --
Help!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
Hello Brenda.
Ray, run faster.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
Let's get outta here.
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Better try a little higher.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Stop touching his brain!
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Noooo!!!
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Father!
That was a great idea, Shorty.
I got it!
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Professor, I think you should see this.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
I can do it myself.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
She's right. We should stick together.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
Would you like to see the girl?
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
This part removes the sense of humor.
"Ray!"
BLOOD FEAST!
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Because it's the rules!
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
CHIP!!
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
Hi, Hank.
No woman would!
Chip, your ride is here.
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
You bring me such peace...
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
What did you just say?
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
So you do drink?
Who wants fruit salad?
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
I'll take this instead.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
I'll give you a check.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What did she want?
What did she want to know?
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
What have you done about Irving August?
Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Let her know what?
I don't know.
And you knew he'd be here.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me -that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
If it is true  there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
Following me to find Jacqueline?
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Yes. When I tell you.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
Dr. Judd?
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
But you would like to know where she is?
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
I didn't know.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Do you have other things?
You play an instrument?
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Why'd you drop out?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Mother, father, sister.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Does it bother you?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Of course not.
This is just... so...
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
How did you know?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
Yes.
I guess not.
About me?
Can't.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
I can't.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Like maybe a big part?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Why are you ashamed?
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Loud.
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
And what?
Lose something?
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
No, I didn't.
Questions about sex.
Apparently.
Because I wanted to.
I wanted him to see me.
Why?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
Do you have my work number?
Who are you?
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
About what?
You just want to ask me questions?
How do we start?
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Then what happened?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Prettier than Ann?
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
No.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Hello.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
When?
Hello.
Do you want me to stop calling?
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
It won't. I trust him.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
Who?
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Student?
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
Hi, John.
What tapes?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
God, you need help.
Give me your keys.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
One moment.
Mr. Millaney?
He said immediately.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Jesus!
You're the one who found the bodies?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
Yes?
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
You bet, Bert.
How's Brad?
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Infantile regression.
I know, I know, it's just...
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
But...how?
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
McKinley?...McKinley?
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
Mental instability?
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
Could you tell us a little about it?
Could I do that later?
Poor Brad.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
I'm...happy.
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
Isn't she lovely?
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Bye.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
What happened to you guys?
Are you a writer too?
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Whoa, why are we getting off?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
What do you smell?
Are you chewing gum?
Yeah. Tight.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
She what?  When?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
So what should I wear?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Where were you?
Besides what?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
What do you think's going on?
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Fucker hit into us.
With Maya.
I said okay?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
You know what I'm thinking?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Me?
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
What the fuck!
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Oh yeah? How is it?
Are you all right?
Hi.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
You got kids?
What's the title?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Bathroom over there?
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Okay. See you around.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
I had class.
About two-thirty.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Hello?
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Where are you?
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
That was fun last night.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Stephanie! Stop!
It was a surprise, Mom.
You talked to Wendy?
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
No.
The same windows.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
You do?
Explain noises.
It was very dark.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Merrill --
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
I'm getting out now.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
It's not broken.
I don't think so.
Is he okay?
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Where are we?
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
Kate?
Gotta go.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
Doesn't look quite fair.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
Where is Rae?
What about the law?
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
Never will again.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
This a friend of yours?
What's all this then?
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Now let's talk about you chaps.
The jury saw it differently.
Hello, Rae.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
What makes you think I could?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
Hello, Cobb.
I see you're prospering without me.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
You really are a gambler.
What is it that I can't figure?
Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
The picture's dead.
Why isn't she with you?
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Hair and make-up?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
What?... What did you say?
You're with me to be close to her?
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
How will you do our love scenes?
You can't.
Is she here?
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
-- We call them "vactors".
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
She still with Kent?
There was no other way.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
She thinks you're with Simone.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
Nice boat, Taransky.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
Maybe he can.
--My God.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
I forgot your name.
You want to ask me a question?
Where should I look then, Cole?
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
What kind of words?
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
I didn't know you were funny.
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
What makes you think that?
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
Did you think the play sucked big time?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
--What?
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
What are you thinking, Momma?
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
You know that accident up there?
Someone got hurt.
You see ghosts, Cole?
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
What--
...He doesn't get invited places.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Good for you.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
I happen to be a professional.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
You're out of your mind, man.
Are you crazy?
He means moon shining.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
You'll be back.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Down boy.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Shit!
Yeah. That's just the problem.
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
So?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
Getting ready.
You wouldn't understand.
Suzie... No.
No --
Listen to me --
Bill, you're Chief of police now.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Looks like a chipmunk.
Who's the lucky fella?
Meat.
Sure thing, killer.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
You're my princess, aren't you?
I loved you. I loved --
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
You.
Get your hands off my daughter!
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
You have a great profile.
Can I ask you something?
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
What kind of a guy is he?
What are you gonna do when you get home?
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
But you'll do it?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Cledus.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Bandit?
Liquid gold.
Hit the brakes!
You can't swear on these.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
Talk to me.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Bandit two, you read me?
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
Is your security team armed?
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Really?
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
Yeah, we've been through that.
About what?
Do you want me to say I did it?
...I'm sorry...
I am. Yeah.
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
That's probably him now...
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
My debrief --
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Wow.
No shit.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
For real?
Why?
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
I DON'T KNOW!
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
You'll end up like me.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
That's fantastic.
You killed her!
She'll come back.
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
Is there anybody else here?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
How much sleep do you need?
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
What are you going to report back to Earth?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
They come when you sleep.
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
What plan?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
When did this happen?
Don't.
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
You want to fuck her?
You still don't believe in God?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
You're the coward.
Do you want to stay here?
What's wrong?
What's happening to us?
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Is that really what you want?
What does it want?
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
You live in Manhattan?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
So, this could be your last night, huh?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
You put me life in danger.
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop being nuts!
Yeah.
I don't know you...
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Are you okay?
What a memory.
It wouldn't work.
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
I'll miss you, Mike.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
My ass if falling.
What shit, honey?
She's got to identify him.
I'd identify him.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
Bought it.
What did she say the down payment was?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
Ellie...
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
What about when she identifies him?!
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
Are you in charge here?
I asked for the man in charge...
Hold it...!
Bullshit!  Prove it.
How do you know where the gun is?
Nice threads Dad.
You coming in?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Flash, drop it--
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Flash, get lost.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
How are you doing, kid?
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
Yeah--
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
What are you doing this weekend?
Sit down and stop being such a child.
Well, no.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
Of course.
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
A match made in heaven.
Poison emergency.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
Mr. Parker.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
I asked if you felt like a drink--
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Jawohl.
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
Private property, bub.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Come again?
How did he get over there?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
Jawohl!
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Let me go! Let me go!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
No, Animal.
You did?
I'll open mine now.
You're crying, Animal.
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Says me.
Lay off, Sefton.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Who did?
You off your rocker?
Go on.
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
Yeah?
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Ach so!
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
What guy?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
That is my wife.
You heard him.
Toh-pak-cha=8A
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Are any of them inhabited?
Well?
Can you locate them?
Do you remember him?
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
These are my children...my children.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
We don't have a tractor beam.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
Kirk here.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Sir?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
The royal...studs?
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Calm yourself, Bones.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Aye sir, coding now.
Hello, sir. It's David.
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
What's wrong?
How many more?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Would you look at that?
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Yours...?!
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.

Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... Or the one.
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
What you ask is difficult.
What about Spock?
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
My Lord... what are your orders?
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
You're not going in there -- !
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
Khan could be down there!
Until now.
I still don't under --
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
You did this -- in a day?!
Does that about do it?
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
Well done, Commander.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
Where's Dr. Marcus --
Why didn't you tell me?
It's a long story.
Let go -- he can't -- !
They won't --
We'll lose them if they go in there.
Yours... is... the superior...
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Time's up, Admiral...
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
We'll be going to warp speed --
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
And who is this?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
I know of your fondness for antiques.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
They knew just where to hit us.
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Not enough against their shields.
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
A distinct possibility.
That's it?
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
May I speak, sir?
That was a little joke.
Khan!
On screen...
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
I really must thank you.
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
I can't get power, sir!
Shields activated!
The question is irrelevant.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
I do this because I was there,
How're you doing?
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Bones --
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
It doesn't look all that different.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
An experimental device, doctor.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
You're saying... It is a compliment.
What's causing that!?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
No choice now, Scotty!
You sure you won't change your mind?
Back to San Francisco.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
What's that?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
It's true... what you said...
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
Hey! -- Where you going?!
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Where are you going?!
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
There is a 20th Century possibility.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
I meant --
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Warp two... three...
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
Ready sir.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Bearing!
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
Admiral! There be whales here!
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Hello? Computer...?
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
Don't panic...
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Don't you ever get tired?
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Chase me!
Why not...?
Won't he rust?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
Will he live?
Yes... that looks like them.
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
I do not take orders from you.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
Would you like something to eat?
Captain...
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Why would we be involved with these people?
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Why don't you try sitting up?
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
It's Cochrane.
Are you saying they won't help us?
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
No. I will not betray my friends.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Isn't it better like this...?
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
Dispersive armor is holding.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
What did you do to the batteries?
This must be it.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
What's still there?
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
Where in the States?
Where are you from most recently?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
What do you want?
Invasion.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Cochrane?
Did you need something?
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Life signs?
Port battery, ready sir!
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Emergency override!
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Worf? Is something wrong?
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Or not to be -
What the Hell's going on?
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
Are we playing multiple choice?
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
This is fun...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
Would you care to go topside?
WHAT HAPPENED?
What?
Are those your words?
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
Klingon blood.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Just the prototype.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
What the -
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
The peace conference.
Are you dining on worms?
But I am not human. I am only -
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
If you are logical.
Direct hit -
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
Can you remember our father?
I do not understand.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Remember him?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Data!
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
We are losing dorsal shields.
Why am I looking at me?
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
May I have this dance?
I'm going to miss you.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
Imzadi. This is so good.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
You're not here.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
What's he doing?
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
What's this?
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Serving with you has been an honor.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
In time, Jean Luc.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
I don't know.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
How long?
And?
But surely...
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guards whip and you'll soon understand patience.
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
What do you think of America?
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Where did you stop last?
Where's that?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
It's real, George.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Contain it and get back to me.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
Clarify that.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
Hello George.
What's all this for?
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
What?
Steering wheel...
Money.
No gas.
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
No gas.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Who?
What?
What is...  ...Coke?
I will see it next time.
When do you have to be here?
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
Eh... yes...
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
Goodbye.
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
You did? That's funny. So did we.
You liked my singing?
Put that back.
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
What?
Good morning.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
They are beautiful.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
There.
What do I do now?
Help me!!
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Can you see under the faceplate?
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
You married, Major?
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
Where are you going?
I told you...
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Hello...
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
I made my choice, Lenny.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
Faith, call me, okay?
You have to go.  I mean it.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
What's going on?
Clips.
Sounds good.
That's not sayin' much.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
What stuff?
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
So there never was a death squad.
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
About what?
It's alright.  He means it.
Nero.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
Is this great fabric or what?
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
How's Zander?
Where we going?
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
Tell me.
Who's Strickland?
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
I guess.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
Mace... you're a girl.
What is that?
But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
No.
Anybody talk to the press?
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Who knows.
You tell me.
Dylan here.
You heard?
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
I've been looking for you.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
Why did you go to Chicago?
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
There was talk of a file photo.
Dick Low's a killer too.
Don't even go there. What's up?
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
I've been thinking about this.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Hello?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
But why this pattern?
You okay?
Jaime --
Who are you?
Suspect Zero?
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
Was it Zero?
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I want to help you.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
Koessler?
Ever since I've known you.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
How are you ladies doing this evening?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
I like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
Like what?
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Let me just check on my boy.
Always...
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
On the table.
You have to lay it on the table.
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...well, it suits you...
Hello?
Lorraine?
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
How are you doing?
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
So what's the difference?
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
There's the rub.
I mean, I need the money.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I didn't mention her once today.
You want to hit the town tonight?
I'll give you an eight.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
You little bitch!
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Mike?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
That's where we make our scene.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
That's bullshit.
I know. I know.
Baby, you did fine.
Oh... a Dorothy.
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
Sorry about interrupting...
Yeah, a good friend.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
He drives a carriage.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Who? Rob?
...the Copa, in New York...
What are you doing?
Please, don't mess with me right now...
It's not like that...
Bitch... You little bitch!
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
What a surprise...
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
You're money.
...Shut up, Sue...
It is on.
Sorry man.
...Okay, two...
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
No.  You ask for too much.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
Is it necessary?
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
You mean Tattaglia.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
I know.
Things went badly in Palermo?
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Ever seen anything like that before?
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
One of Tattaglia's people?
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
What was that?
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
What about McCluskey?
Mike, why am I out?
I've never seen anything like it.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
You like spaghetti?
Then the legs at the knees...
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
What time do they expect us?
Michael, what are you doing?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Michael?
Hello.  Kay?
I LOVE YOU.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
Do you wish to be baptized?
Let us fill up our Regimes.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
Buy me out?...
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
I'll come down.
Shut up.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
He's drowning me!
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient.
What does he say?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I've got plans!
Why?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
You should watch that!
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I never said that!
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
Hello Marge.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Dickie?
What?
Look at me what?
Very.
I found Dickie's rings.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
I told you. He gave them to me.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
Is this you?
What's funny?
What's your secret?
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Dickie, my God!
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Ditto.
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
My God.
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Hello. What are you up to?
Was that Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Why lie?
Dickie Greenleaf?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
Yes?
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
What did you do?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction".
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
What are you doing?
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
Well... mostly...
Hello, Travis.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Oh, are you all right?
No, why?
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Betsy, come over here a moment.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Yeah. We went to Harvard together.
Where.
Huh?
Well... I guess so.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
That ain't much of a name.
That's a nice name.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
But that one night?
God, you are square.
Who's a killer?
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
How?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
You're not much with girls, are you?
You don't have to.
What do you mean?
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
Twenty-six.
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
I'm no cop.
Get it.
Wiz?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Well, I just, you know...
Not really.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
He's got a gun, sir.
I see you got the telegram.
Dad?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
What.
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
City hall?
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
What was that?
Do you have the...
Were we going to get married?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Well, there's got to be a way...
When did you start smoking?
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
Wait'll you see the inside!
Well...
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Jesus...
I'm here.
Did I what?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Zackly.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Any idea how you got here, son?
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
You kids off to the dance?
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Cigarette?
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Sit.  Play with me.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Found me.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
What happened?
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Will you help me, Sandy?
I suppose.  Thanks.
Who?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Do you think I should go?
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
The two kids?
I see. How do I get down there?
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Where would I get a boat?
I wonder if you could tell me...
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
Gulls!
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
In a bird shop.
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
Where will we go?
They're gone. The same pattern.
They won't be.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
That's the last of it.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Some of them are.
But how... how do you know my name?
What are you? A policeman?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
I think you're a louse.
What kind of law?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
Why...
Oh, no you don't!
You like me, huh?
Certainly, but...
I'm sure.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
You were lying.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
I do different things on different days.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Do you want some mustard with this?
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Melanie...
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
The town looks clear.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
Have we still got power?
You must be exhausted.
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Have you got a pencil?
Yes, certainly.
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
How do you plan to do that?
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
But you did promise.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
See that, Fettes?
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
No.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
This is a gift you'll not return.
I would make you rich.
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
Can anyone hear what we say?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
But where did they get those people?
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
She would if she could.
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
We won't.
You think I'm crazy.
Think maybe knives do?
You lied at my trial.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
Fuck. Me.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
The scar. Which of you has it?
I was a friend of your sister's.
Yeah, no kidding.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
No. You don't.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
You know.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
Anything wrong?
But you, you've had them.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Erin!
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
You wrote this?
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
Such power exists?
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Did you have a nice day, dear?
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Your impatience is quite understandable.
It was a wonderful day.
I wonder if we ought to--
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
I don't know how to thank you.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
Hello.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
Is it worth anything?
No -- no, thanks.
Well, how do I know who you are?
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
That's right.
We were gonna grab some food.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Where is she?!
You can't kill me, Star.
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
I thought they'd be in coffins.
Oh, no...
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
Of course not!
David.
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
Good!
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
You didn't tell David?
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
I'll hitch.
We're getting close...
Where's Michael?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
Not impressed, are you?
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Does it burn?
Are you following me?
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
It's gone.  I feel it!
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
Go away.
Did you spill something?
I'm making you a sandwich.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Michael?
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
You can't let anybody leave!
How you doin', old boy?
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
You catch anything he was saying?
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Torch it over there!
MacReady!
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
We should have jumped his ass.
Neither will we.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
My God, what in hell happened here?
What are you doing?
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Looks good.
What's...
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
What kind of test?
Tie up Clark, too.
What if it doesn't come?
What about Childs?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
You hear that?
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
Because you'll never die.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Machines?
This has to end.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
What's your name?
No, we created the Morlocks.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
What?
Why would you let me go back?
Why?
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
And why not?
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
May I help you?
You're late.
Well there's something new.
Talk away, Professor.
All right, what is it now?
I know it's not a diamond but --
Darling.
All right...
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
My God...
We took a walk three days ago.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
I was not.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
You won't say that in a week.
Is there a lot of illness?
His curiosity is amazing.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Yes.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Mara -- what -- ?!
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
"Eloi"?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
What do you mean?!
Sir, if I may --
Yes, sir.
How did you get hurt?
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Who are you?
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
How did you come to know their names?
Do I know you from somewhere?
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
I thought you said you never knew your father.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
I need to get this letter to someone.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
Your mom take anything before this happened?
[Beat] What's your name?
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
I gave you my dog tags.
[Beat] You bled to death.
They're not here.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
What?
You were convicted of the crime.
Exactly.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
How do you know about Eugene?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
You ever been to jail?
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
Well, where are you from?
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Well, how'd you get here?
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
You don't think that's crazy?
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
How?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Darryl.
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
Why?
On what?
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
What kind of gun was it?
Good God.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
Stop.
Louise, is that you?
What did ya do?
You're a bank robber?
What?
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Where'd y'all go?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Hello...
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Is this your car?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
In case of what?
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Thelma!
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
You're not touchin' that car.
Did you finish thinking?
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
You're disturbed.
Thelma.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Louise?  Where are we?
Idaho?
Now what?
What little dogs?
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
What?!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
No.
You awake?
We've gone insane.
What?!  What d'you think?!
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
You're a good friend.
God!  It looks like the Army!
Go.
I'm not apologizing for shit!
We're fine!  How are you?
Where you goin'?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
No harm, no foul?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
I mean since then.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
No You mean...?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Check.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Mary.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
We're in love with your roommate.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Oh yeah.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
By the way, what's your name?
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Any idea where I might start looking?
All you want is a phone number?
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Among others.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
You what?
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
I see where you're going.
How do you guarantee that?
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
What's up, Doc?
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
I think you'd better sit down.
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Now by killer, you mean...?
Twenty-two.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
So you're a writer?
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Please leave.
Go!
Get over here.
Yeah? What do you want?
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Is it the frank or the beans?
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
Piggyback ride.
Starshells.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
And?
Slow down. Smell that?
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
The sun came up today.
John. How much time?
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
How long until the army is ready?
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
So what've we got today?
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
What's this about?
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
What the hell you doing?!
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Couldn't sleep.
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
Alright. Alright...
I'll sleep around a little.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Tread matches. It's the car.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
What?!
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
What was he saying?
That's not solid.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
This Clear Moon's house?
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
He's gone.
Who did?
Your relatives must've taught you something.
X21, give me a 20.
Ray. X22.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
No way. No fuckin' way.
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
I thought he'd never leave.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
You saw a MiG 21?
It never came up.
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Yes. I'll give you that!
What about the plane?
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
It dies. We live.
No!
And now I want you.
I want it understood.
Lucky charm.
That's what you get flight pay for.
How do you play reality.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
Off me or off you?
What does it mean?
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
Tomcats?
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
That's missile lock!
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
Were upside down!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
What are you doing?
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
I've got it -- hold on!
Gotta go, man.
Is there something I should know?
Why do you all have such funny names?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Tom Kazansky.
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
1000.
Mav's a great flyer but....
A plaque?
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
ON THE NOSE?
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
I've seen this before.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
You won?!!!
You didn't help.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
Welcome to Mars.
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
What happened to number five?
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
Kill him.
Bob?
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
What do you want?
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Yeah.
They sell fake memories.
I don't know.  Maybe.
No shit...
I did?
What are you, my father?
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
I want that fucker dead.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
He's not at ground level.
I've got a lock!  There!
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Lori...
--I got a trip to Mars.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
The hell you're not.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
I suppose you're not here either.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Doug...Bob McClane.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
Why would I lie to you?
I think you better leave.
I'm not falling for it.
Wait!
...Who are you?
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
How much you think?
What the hell is that, anyway?
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
I might have an idea...
You know, up the jeep trail.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
You're really leaving, huh?
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
You're full of shit.
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
Fuck you!
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
This is one big mother!
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
They're...they're trying to make us move!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Yeah...but no ties.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
Twenty.
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Darn it!
What's it doing?
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
I brought it... to the coroner.
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
Don't hurt him.
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Objection.
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
"We"?
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
You see that? You wanna be like that?
We have a full caseload, Rog.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Where?
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
What other case?
Do you have to do that?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
A fucking wheelchair?
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
Let's get a cab.
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
...Jesus!
Murder witness.
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
-- How could I help you?
Edward T. Dowd.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
I don't think I know that name.
No.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
You getting this?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
What color hair will she have?
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
We can do it right here.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
Can you tell me what their names were?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You try that you little monkey.
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
What is it, Gordon?
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
No.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
Accidental?
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
Agent Desmond, it's...
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
You better dust this place, Sam.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Noooo...
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
The usual, 9:15.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Oh god, Laura.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Where are you going?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
How did the car get back here?
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
Laura, do you love me?
I've got to see you.
What about tonight?
What do you mean?
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
School?
Who was that?
Dad?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Did you get this from your lover?
Bobby didn't give you this?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
When's the next business trip, big fella?
I don't know.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
What did he find?
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Just now...
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Neurology?
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Objection, we've...
Objection!
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
Well, many reasons, actually...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
I didn't do too well for you.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I am on the staff of...
She getting good care over there?
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
Thank you.
I used to be a nurse.
Yes.
A single hour.
I need an extension for my case.
Maybe I can do something right.
Is this a bad time.
Why don't you get some rest?
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
You're pressuring yourself...
Pardon?
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Then why don't you testify?
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
Dr. Gruber.
Another, Frank...?
Uh...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
Who have we got?
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
...Gruber's not bad.
You got a good memory, Franky.
What happened, Joey...?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
...four years ago...
I just saw her.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...of the procedures...
What happened in those three...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
There's nobody left around here now.
You look kinda lost yourself.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Can I read it?
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Heather?
Diabetes?
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
These look quite fresh.
You going away?
This is going to give you nightmares.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
When do you think it'll be done?
I've never mentioned it to him.
Really?
Studio B.
Heather, what is it?
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Captured?  How?
Then what is he doing?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
Yes?
Uh...sure...when?
Now?
He would have loved this.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
You sound so sure.
Why did we begin this?
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
What are they doing?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
You know, I never had friends like this.
I thought this was your dream come true.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Hey, shut up will ya?
You only hurt yourself you know?
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
Good.
Ya know... "It".
My parents don't do it anymore.
That's how he died you know.
Yes, sir.
You all right?
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
But you invited is aboard.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
Oh, really?
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
Immortality.
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Don't ever call me stupid.
They tell you that?
It matters to me.
What?
We've got a problem.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
What are we supposed to talk about?
But, they don't speak English.
Phil.  What are you doing?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Suicidal...
Do you have something to say?
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
I can't be sure.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
For killing a dolphin.
Yes, that's true.
Yes.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
What's Cao Ben?
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
Whattaya mean family?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
So, it's back to the islands.
Oh, many things...
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
Hasta siempre.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Hey baby...
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
You okay, honey?
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
Actin' funny how?
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
You got me, peanut.
I do.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Who do?
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
You knew my daddy?
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
You upset with me?
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
You been drinkin', huh?
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
So where'd you say you was?
Let's leave here.
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
Mama???
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Course I am, mama.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Where? In the leg?
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Santos... What's happenin' here?
I know... I remember.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Actually... I just want to go home.
He's fine. He's narrating.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
Mm.
He said something about being between things.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
He has a book.
He is. Take my word for it.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Tripp?!
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Kidnapped? By who?
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Shut up, James.
Want some help with that?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
The hood jumper?
Came to my senses.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
I'll be... somewhere else.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
I passed out.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
I've been trying to finish a book...
Vernon.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Yes. But that's not why I called...
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Yes.
Washed up?
Professor Tripp?
How did I get here last night?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
I just wanted a little sip.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
So, why did you take me up there?
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
When?
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Get out of here.
Me? Sure. Why?
That strikes me as odd.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
But where? I need the street.
Professor Tripp.
I need to talk to you.
You go first.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Well...
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Not have it.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Pow.
Who's that sitting in your car?
Oh?
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
You don't deserve me, you know.
The more the merrier.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
What made you pull out that old thing?
Maybe I should read it.
Where's Emily, Hank?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
One hundred and twenty feet.
I'm working on it.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
I've got some good news.
Soon.
It's not what you think.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
They're starlings.
You should hear the bird.
What's up?
You don't know?
Okay?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I wasn't feeling well.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
So. How are you adjusting?
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
I'm twelve.
Walter.
But will he... ?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
It's getting dark. Go home.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
Why not?
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
Try it.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
How do you feel about that?
Then why are you talking about this?
What are you afraid will happen?
Why do you think you're here?
How do you define it?
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
You're very late.
To relax.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
What the hell are you doing there?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
I'm talking about you.
What's weird about that?
Southern light.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
Doesn't it get noisy?
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
I'm not easily shocked.
So... what's your dark secret?
Hey, that was... intense.
What's the worst thing you ever did?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
Most people say the odds are against me.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
I got poked around... here and there.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
It's a bad idea.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Thank you.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
You done impressing yourself, ace?
You got it?!  You got it?
I'm taking you back out.
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
What's the scoop, ace?
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Jesus, Lindsey--
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
You totaled it, huh?
Well, that's that.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
It is insane.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Virgil?
That's Perry.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Is that it?  Is this right?
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Stand by on the ROV.
4800 feet.  It's official.
What kind of light?
When do you have to go back?
How are you?
Which one shall I wear?
And how long will you be away?
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
Somebody must live here!
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
Don't be so humble.
Shall we go for a swim?
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Does it please you to say such things?
Then why do you say them?
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Claudia, let's get married?
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
I love you.
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
Giulia...
Why don't you try?
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
What other boat?
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
Thank you.
Are you the owner of this place?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Did you manage to find good rooms?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Why have we stopped?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
Because...
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
I'm being punished.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
For what?
I just heard you.
Who?
Uh huh.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
You've been alone together?
What baby?
I... I don't understand.
Anything?
Would you like to be?
Why should I?
What else did she tell you?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
You have trouble sleeping?
What things?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
And you're unhappy.
Sometimes, yes.
What did you do?
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
You can tell me.
Why?
Oh, yes.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Are you intelligent?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Did you want it to come out?
Why?
Would you like to tell me?
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
You don't like brussel sprouts?
Hm hmm.
No.
For me to get sick in.
Of what?
Who?
Is someone in the room with you?
Agnes, can you hear me?
She said Michael.
No...
Not your fault...
I hate him for what he did to me.
For what he made me go through.
I don't know.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Thanks.
All I want is one more week.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
No.
Do you still go to church?
What's his name?
I believe Agnes is different.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
I've already told you what I thought.
That's absurd!
I was appalled, just as you are now.
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
The Catholic Church...
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
You lied to me
Listening to angels?
Do you know what she did to her?
She molested her!
We'll see about that.
I haven't decided yet.
An unhappy woman...
Bullshit yourself!
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Would you like one?  Huh?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
I'd like to begin.
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Who knew she was pregnant?
Too late for what?
The baby?
You wanted that child out of the way.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
You tied the cord around its neck.
Of course, John.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
What about all these letters?
Can you fix him for me?
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
You don't think...
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
Ever seen one of these before?
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Grotty?
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Ringo!
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
No, I didn't you did ...
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Gear?
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Aye, I knew you were.
But that's not like a real person at all.
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Parading's better!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
You're only right.
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
And we're looking after him, are we?
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
That'll keep you busy.
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
What are you doing there?
That little old man.
How d'you reckon that one out?
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
I hope he fell off.
Behave...
Y'what?
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Hello.
Is it?
Aye, but you know him well.
Well!
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
That's mine.
Well ...
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Stop picking on him.
Yeah, you want to watch it.
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
What?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Locked.
Can you get it a little closer?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
What's up?
Maybe we can get in by the top.
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
Computer, what language was that?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
What the hell's going on?
Oh -- God -- oh --
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
So does anybody have any suggestions?
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
Now we're in for it.
Yes?
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
We've got six hours left.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
<u>How</u>?
It will be.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
What?  What was that?
What do you mean, no?
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
Don't count on it.
This should do it.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
Oh God, oh God no.
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
I thought I'd find you here.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
They're getting pretty close now.
Okay.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Where are we?
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
But?
Still worried?
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
This ship is full of cat hair.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Now what?
Now what?
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
What is it?
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Give or take.
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Where're they headed?
Not yet.
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Hold it, hold it...
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Is it still moving?
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
That's what we thought.
Already working on it.
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
They knocked out the external feeds.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Do you believe him?
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
What do you take me for?
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
Then say so.
Because I don't want to.
We never met. That's why.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Didn't you know?
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
You've already met.
Good luck, genius...
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
I told her. I sounded off.
Bill...
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Then you're crazy.
You in a hurry?
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
I'll check with Eve...
It's a good thought.
Happy little housewife...
When I'm guest of honor?
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
No heart to burn.
Addison-!
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
It's obvious you're not a woman.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Why what?
Every day.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
Yes. Yes, it does.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
- and for you.
The same size?
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
You don't like Eve, do you?
An answer.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
It was for my report.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
I'm going to take you to Margo...
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
If I only knew how...
Not just that way. As a friend...
I think she would cheer.
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
He can help you.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
I think I know...
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
She knows enough not to be here.
Congratulations, Eve.
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
What - again?
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
How far to the station?
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
He's in love with you.
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
It's just possible she didn't...
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
I never said it was!
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
That depends.
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
"Liebestraum."
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--no way--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
All right, what do we know?
Hey?
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
Goddamnit--
--I'm trying--
See her?  Get anything?
And?--And?--
Anything you've got.
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
Who'd you vote for?
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
What's the matter?
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury.
Woodward?
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
Tell that to Muskie.
Can't help you.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--no--
I thought you had to get to Miami.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
I really can't talk now--
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
--what do you think?--
We can't talk inside either?
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Talk about Segretti--
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
Where?
Where?
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
What else have you got?
--no--
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
No, it was good.
Good work, Ostreicher.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
This is your plan, Finch?
Of course, Finch.  What?
What are we gonna hear?
What do you suppose they're saying?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Um...Chris --
Do I have to?
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
You want onions?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
What about the game?!
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
...I've never tried it.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
Do you?
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
There's our man.
Gotta go.
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
You can send me the address too.
Did I miss anything?!
That's stupid.
How do you know that?
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
You're not...busy?
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Whatever you want.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Yeah, bring it on!
...excuse me?!
She's a mermaid, dude.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Who cares?
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
So you need to change, right?
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Shame on you!
No, not again.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Now?!
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah Vick?
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Then she said -- she loves me.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
Okay, explain.
...Guess what?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
That junior chick?
<u>Yeah</u>!
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Ha-ha!
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Serafine...
I don't know...
Are you crazy!?
Holy mother of God...
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
Claude...?
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
Uncle Terrence?
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Enough. Cut him loose.
What did she say?
Well?
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Why were you so late tonight
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Hurry, Grandmama!
Are you running away?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
You'll laugh.
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too
You never thought of the possibility?
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Come on!
Oh! I'm sorry...
Don't let me go!
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
Trust me, it's her!
It's her.
How is our current financial status?
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
I did no such thing!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Hey, you on television?
What's your name?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
We've been through this.
Lyndon Johnson?
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
He was creepy.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Oh, right.
No, I got time.
Duane?
Why not?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
I know.
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
what I mean?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
Yeah.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Really, do you think so, really?
Yeah?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
No.  You're a wreck.
Yeah?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
big subject with me, yeah.
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Yeah, I know it's small.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
What are you doing?
Really?
Were you always funny?
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Is he in the bathroom?
Two?
Okay, let me have this.
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Remember, we had that thing.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
God, it's so clean out here.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
God.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
You look very pretty.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
Here you are. There's people out there.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
What-
Bad?
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Tsch, a few.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Who said that?
Probably on their first date, right?
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Just give me the license, please.
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
But she's colored.
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Yeah.
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
It has your ring.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
Oh.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
You should have brought him.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Let's get the kids.
He's gonna miss his flight.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
Directing suits you.
Just did.  Jealous?
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
So?
What is it?
And?
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
And you know our friends, how?
We've heard lots about you.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
We closed.
Yes.
Kiss the back of my knees.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
What?
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
Not properly watered.
She left the fucking gate open.
Fuck you.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
I don't look my age, Joe.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Anyone else?
I don't want to go tonight.
No.
That's under lock and key.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Yes, she is.
Do I put you off?
And I you.
Ah.
The infamous dog?
Ours.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
I'm a little nervous, so...
I'm a little in the puke zone.
Lemon or raspberry?
Ryan's really angry with me.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
That's very nice.
I think there are sixteen there.
What?
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
How's he doing?
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Are you making an ass of yourself?
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
I'm so sorry.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
She's all over him, are you blind?
Shit!
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Well, something's wrong.
We're going to have to go back out there.
I didn't know you had this.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
What <u>was</u> that thing?
I order you to find out where we are!
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Worker!  Come back here now!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
And only you can become a Queen?
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Why do they have you tied up here?
Of course not --
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Who is that idiot?
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
Not that one.  Or that one.
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
May I cut in?
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Wear this.
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
Ma'am?
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
No.
Eight-thirty.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Three.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
And where are you now?
What's her first name?
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
You are?
Why not?
Who was that?
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Who?
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
How would you like to go tonight?
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
I am?
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Put me down for Thursday again.
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
Yes, sir.
Naturally.
Don't mind what?
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
No, no -- just had a little accident.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
What are you going to do, Doc?
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
How do you spell her last name?
Yeah, wasn't I?
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
What's this -- you packing?
Where are you moving to?
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Who is Mickey?
Family?
Not so rough, honey.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Will you excuse me?
Well -- thank you.
How long has it been -- a month?
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Coming?
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Where does she live?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
We need all our fuel anyway.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
Moonby what?
Delta ?
Rangers, eh?
I was an FO for the 25th.
Yeah.
Why they call you that?
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
What do you see?
And the grass?
Who's he?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
What the hell is it?
I --
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Listen.
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
I only met Kurtz once.
Our Recon flight ?
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
We don't want to bother you any, we --
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
What's your name, sailor ?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.
Why did you come to ... my province.
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
Did you know him very well?
Maybe he'll get tubed.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
This one , Lance?
What?
Simple. They don't want him to go.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --

Had?
How did she..?
He's coming around fine.
Stay here.
That's not what I meant.
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
Let's go.
You're hurt.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Does he have people?
Be my guest.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Answer and I'll shoot!
Can you walk?
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
All this for laying traps on private land?
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
I need to rent a cabin.
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
If Corbett's men find out --
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
There's what they're waiting on!
What is it you want? What?
How was it talking to him?
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
How long has he been having problems?
Have they done blood tests on him?
Me. My home number is on this card.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
Oh, please...
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
What needs clearing up?
Lovely.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Hello?
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
I should've danced with you.
What do you want, Melvin?
Was this supposed to be your room?
Can you not be violent?
Uh-huh...
Good night.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
What the heck are those for?
What the heck do you mean?
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Actually, I don't think so.
Terrify me?
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Yeeeess!!!
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Please, just leave.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Would you leave now, please?
I brought you Chinese soup.
Not it at all, really.
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
Because...  ... you love her?
Picking on me won't help.
But you know where you're lucky?
What's wrong?
Okay.
Michael?
Such language in front of a lady.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
Who?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Deadline?
What?
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Bullshit.
You want me to pump?
So this is something between you and him?
Why?
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Because I'm done.
Had?
I killed him.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
More or less.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
No, they didn't.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
My first take?
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Good.
That's where he'll be.
Do you think about the game?
Not even a stalemate?
Really?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
Then, we wait.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
What?
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
What happened?
What did he say?
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Did you think they were newlyweds?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
Why?  I don't know.
Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Four minutes.
Electra --
Was nice.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
I wasn't watching television.
I thought it was interesting --
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Hi.  Did you call --
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
How much farther?
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Can I ask you a question?
You wish to close this account today?
How would you like the funds?
Cheers Katka!
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
Who's your friend?
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
Like Custer huh?
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Tell them we're working for the University.
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
It must be on the other side of this.
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Nope.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Afternoon!
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
My God! What happened?
What happened to Katka?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
A fine specimen for conversion.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
You don't understand, I can't!
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
You're sure?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
I've been around.
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
I thought for sure they would catch me.
Will it help to get you out?
Forget about me Kat.
Hi, want to take up dancing?
Sure, they are students.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
You mean it's started?
How do I know what's being said?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
A champion of lost causes huh?
Is it dry?
What would you like, beer?
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Who you saving the dishes for?
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
Really!
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
I'm not sure it's possible.
And the students?
No, just a drill.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Why are there still such headlines?
You are responsible...What has happened?
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
And what of these foreigners?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
She asleep?
What if they expel you?
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
Were you with Jamie?
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Deranged.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
'Is it really me?'
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
What's with the friggin numbers?
I'm an enemy?
So what else is on this list?
I know. Don't say anything.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
You're really into God, right?
The play's going to be really good.
People can see.
What does that mean?!
Like fire.
Yes. But not as a date date.
Is there a rush?
It's only 7:30.
You're acting like a crazy person.
Assholes. This happen to you?
Are you trying to seduce me?
You're worried about your college applications.
What are you going to -- ?
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
Help me live until I die?
What are you thinking?
I've talked to your father.
I'll talk to your father.
By accident --
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
This week.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
How about your family?
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
You know about this stuff?
You've been well?
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
So what did we just make?
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Morning Dick.
What's N.R.C.?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
You mean, you're gonna --
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Who, me?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
What, am I radioactive or something?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
How did you know?
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
I know.
My guess is that she turned him down.
There's no way of knowing.
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
Obviously!
Pretty, isn't it?
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Oh yeah?
We did it, Ray.
You like people?
Good luck to you.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
Okay.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
You still in school?
Doing what?
That's my father. I got to run.
Can I be honest?
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
Don't call me stupid.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Is he upset?
Think I got 'em?
Don't.
Yes.
I'd like to get out of here.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
You didn't walk out here.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
What?
Planet 10?
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
Apache?
Anybody we know?
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
And they got Penny!  Look!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Got a casualty list?
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
What's his problem?
Pictures don't lie.
So where's Buckaroo?
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Hello, Barton.
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
Ever talk to him?
Well that's what he said.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent  don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
...Huh? No, I'm 
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
What do you do far a living?
Well, I'm... glad to hear that 
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Howdy, neighbor.
...Got a sweetheart?
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time 
...This must be boring you.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
Are you sure 
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
It's okay... It's okay...
You'll be back?
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik 
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
Transient or resident?
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
...Okay
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
What did... What did he 
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
Mr. Lipnik, I 
Yes, Colonel.
All night?
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
How are you, Nick?
How about the coke?
How's not smoking?
What are you doing here?
Catherine Tramell.
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
I thought you hardly know her.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
Did you leave the club with him?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
I told you -- I quit.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
You tell me.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
Why take the risk?
How's your new book?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
About three months before I met you.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
Do you believe me?
How'd you get in here?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Why?
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
You think I --
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
Where the hell you goin'?
Maybe the maid did it.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
Fuck you, Phil.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
Who are you?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Who is it?
Is Jean Michel here?
These are great.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
Would you like to see the wine list?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Oh man! Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
What're you doing? You're doing something.
Check you later, man.
No, don't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
You're back.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 
Hi.
What's that?
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
That is amazing. What year is it?
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
What's your name, man?
Hi.
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
'Phillips head,' right?
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
I need this?
Uh-oh!
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
I guess this mean we won.
Where's the fire?
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
We've met.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Well that's a ... long story ...
Pouring myself into my work.
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
And the truth frightened her?
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
... What do we do?
No.  No glass on the inside.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
But I can't can I?
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
I'm on break from-
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Please be looking for me.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
Watch the first step.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
We gotta get those locks changed.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
No sign of the snowman.
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
And she did it all for me.  For love.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
No gun.  How disarming.
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
You will rescue my wife
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
Actually, he took the car.
There's one other thing. I feel..
...Afraid.
How about, MR. E.
Al?
We all wear masks.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
We'll talk some other -
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
Rinka.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Find anything interesting?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Back off, man.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
B-12.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
... How long have I been out?
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
No.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Joker here. Can we talk?
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
... Why the mask?
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
It isn't working any more, David.
Jesus.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Big day today, huh? 78
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
David, David, David ...
You arrange those flowers yourself?
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
So, like, where is she?
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
That's not that much.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Really? I poop too much.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
They perk me right up.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Do her? Huh huh.
Cool. Huh huh huh.
You scored with two chicks?!
You got two seconds!
Wave at the lion.
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
What about this Beetle guy?
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
I feel really stupid.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
What...?
Aren't you scared?
Help vouchers?
Wait for who?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
Are you available?
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
Tell the truth.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
God, you're anatomically correct!
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
W... What is it?
Your qu...?  But you're...
He's your cousin.
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Just don't tell Lydia.
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Stepmother's...
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
Are they suffering?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
What's wrong?
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Is this the key to the attic?
Otho, that's terrible.
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
You were wrong, it did hurt.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Would you care for a drink?
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
What is that?
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
Chauncey...
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Can you see well?
... Are you sure you like it?
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
... Sir?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
... Evening, Chance.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Good morning, Louise.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
Have you served in the Army?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
I have no claim, Thomas.
... In the garden?
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
I can certainly understand that...
... Would you take me on a tour?
It's that gardener!
Good night.
Yes? What have you found?
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
Ben!
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Enjoy.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Hi.
I want to try.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
We?
My God!
It's Elijah.
A better friend.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
So how was it?
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Pardon?
Money, Miss Warts?
Mr. Juarez?
Security.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
What'll you have?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
Im not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're glowing again.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Two hundred dollars, please.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
What kind of circumstances?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Forget it.
Says me. Do you dream often?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Anybody else?
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
What's the play?
How'd you get this number?
Can I get you a drink?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
You still there, sweets?
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
Stay in him forever?
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Vegas.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
You don't sit with me!!
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Be here. In case.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Mama let me help you.
No...no...no..
Out where?
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
You?
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
You planning to do anything about it?
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
Sethe?
You shaved.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
Her life is in your hands.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
Uh-huh.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
The Gundersons.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
Yeah.
What do you mean, Dude?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Where you going, Dude?
I was bowling--
He peed on the Dude's rug--
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Who has your undies, Walter?
What do you need that for, Dude?
What have you.  We'll, uh--
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
No, they--
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
"Johnson"?
You mean coitus?
Oh, no.
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
That's really thoughtful but I--
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
And please don't call her my mother.
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
This was, uh--
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
So who--
Theodore Herzel.
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
What the hell is this?
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
...Huh?
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
Walter--
That wasn't her toe.
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Who the fuck is that?
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Walter, you fuck!
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Another Caucasian, Gary.
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
'Scuse me?
Fuckin' A.
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Oh, shit.
Shit, sorry man.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
Whatta we do about the Mex?
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
What?
You're hurt.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
Blade.
Anyone else make it?
It means "bloodbrother."
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
And so will we.
You got something in mind, Blade?
What's going on?
What the fuck you doing?
His name is Jared Nomak.
Tell me something, Skid --
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Get in. Youre leaving.
Going somewhere?
Don't try to talk --
Whistler, I --
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You're not going anywhere.
Hold out your hands.
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
-- he's a vampire.
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
Is he sick?
Any progress?
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
But you -- died --
This isn't human blood.
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
That's weird --
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
How do you like that? Right on time.
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
What -- ?
Who are you people?
Whistler!
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
Why do you hunt them?
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
What do you mean?
Not that I can see.
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
What're you doing there?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
No.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Anna--
--or someone--
Was that you laughing?
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
Then I'm going--
Are you marked like this??
Oh, Jesus, no--
Absolutely.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--

Me, too.
Where <u>is</u> it?
Fire escape??
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Who?
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
Hold this.
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
What?
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
403 41st Street, kids: home.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
--it's less than four feet, just--
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
Why?
What?
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
Pointless.
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
What'd you see?
Are you alright?
What?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
--bullshit--
Finally got her back to sleep.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
Heather.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
What was that?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...What?
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
...That's what's important.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...What's going on with you two?
...So?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
...You know that car?
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
You want me to kill 'em.
...What?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Is Marty here?
...Why?
Where was I?
What day is it today, Angie?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Come into the study a minute.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
. MOMMY!.
Where are we going, Frank?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Yes? What is it?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Do you like that?
I made it go down the toilet.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
. I. uh.
Nice guy.  Who's he?
Yes. Frank-
Do you like my body?
Shut up.
You. what?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
I'm glad you do.
You called me Jeffrey.
Yes.
Oh no.
Shh. I'll tell you.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Heineken.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Yeah, how did you know?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
What else is new?. right?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
What happened to him?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
So. what's next?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
You really want to do this, don't you?
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Did you see her undressed?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Okay.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Probably not. no. Why?
Are you feeling okay?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Yeah?
What?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
No.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Nothing like this back home.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Honey, your nose!
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What can I do for you guys?
Goodness.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
What kind of project?
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
What type of planes do you have?
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Good to see you, Diego.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
There's no room.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Cocaine?  How much?
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
I know.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Hi.
Give this to Mom, will you?
I meant every word of it.
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
George.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Source?  What about Derek?
Hello.
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
Not in front of the kid.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Hey, George.  You okay?
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
What are you doing here?
What?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
California, huh?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
I fucked up.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Right on.
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Smith.  Hampshire....
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Second name.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Can you read?
Where's Kader?
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
Where were we?
Why?
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Who is speaking?
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
An inquiry into what?
So she knew about his heart?
What did they argue about?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Objection sustained.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
That's ridiculous.
You've been following me?
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Her name?
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Tell the court about that, please.
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
She was here?
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
And how are you now?
Why did she say she was leaving?
Can you give the court an example?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
She was.
Why?
Did you suggest any?
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Why does she come to you?
October twenty-seventh.
Then what happened?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
Did he make your life miserable?
What happened next?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
I've tried it.
No.
--and that he changed his will?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
P.M.
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Yes.
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
Do you think I did it?
Hello?
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Yes -- it would be nice.
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Rebecca -- take these off.
What's that for?
I'm dropping the case.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
Michael -- get off the phone.
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
I can back it up.
This is not relaxing.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
What's she like?
Please -- not now.
It's more involved than that.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
Not even if they're a dork?
Yes.
It had to get there somehow.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
What?!
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Then why do you?
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
Carolyn!
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
No, really?
So, how long you've been living here?
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
Oh, that's nice.
Mind if I smoke?
Where are you staying while you're here?
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Feeling better?
What?
Then what happened?
Why, do you think?
And did you?
Why did you stop?
Do you miss it?
I'm sorry. That was...
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
You must get lonely at times.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
My mistake. I apologize.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Francesca?
Am I interrupting anything?
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Yes.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
I bet you could do a book.
What were you like when you were younger?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Uh-huh. And?
I... What do you want?
STOP IT!
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
Where you going?
Franny?
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
It clearly states in the will --
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
'S up?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
You want us to move in here?
We can climb out.
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
Those 'fools' are my people.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
Please.  It's for your own good.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
Where is it?
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Please...help me...
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
Gimme the gun.
Not bad.  What for?
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
It couldn't have been.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Where is the money?
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
But everybody is all right.
Another time.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Are they really?
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Yeah.
Do you know him?
Caesar is your husband?
Okay, one drink.
Curious, maybe.
I wanted to apologize.
No.
How did you meet him?
Five years is a long time.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
You said he washed the money?
Then what?  Exactly.
What?
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
What happened?
Does Johnnie hit on you?
What time did you say they would be there?
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
Why?
He'll have to run.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I had a partner and she fucked me.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
I know you will.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
No.  We can't risk it.
We don't know what we're into!
What do you mean?
Treadstone?
Yes.
Are you Treadstone?
That's all I get?
I don't think so.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
You have your passport?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
We thought you were gone for good.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
I've got a situation here and --
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
So what's in Paris?
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
What if I say no?
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
What does that mean?
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
We're about an hour away.
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
Where?
So this is it, right?
I should go.
Okay, so...
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
He came to kill us.
You knew he was coming.
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
Stop where you are.
xxxxxx
You have ID?
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
Where's the dog?
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
Tell him we're busy.
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What the fuck is he doing?
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
...ervices.
...ixed itself.
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Go away.
What's the matter?
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
Christ! You do know it all!
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Out of kindness.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
It could all be coincidental.
Where do I get it stamped?
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them!
Don't litter my cab!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Why?
It's heavy.
No, really.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
They'll be there waiting.
Shit! The house is on fire!
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Don't you like parties?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Isn't it? Whose is it?
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
Here. What do I do next?
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
Damn! Blast!
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
I know that.
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
You want to take my console into your office?
You remember Samuel, my son.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Sam!!!
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Uh ...
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
My I.D. cards.
But I could be anybody.
Can you fix it?
Are you expecting anyone?
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
No underwear?
Where is she?
She wanted something to help her sleep.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
You're not going to die.
You shouldn't smoke.
He's better, isn't he?
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
Backup?
He got better.
You can't believe how much he's improved.
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
Would you like to come in?
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
The brakes are shot.
Let's get in a fight, then.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Turn it off.
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
Don't push it, Larry.
Faster! God!
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
Stomach again.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
What did I do to you?
How <u>you</u> doing?
Shut up a second...
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
No.  No.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
You were smokin' toward the end there.
You packing up tonight?
I don't think so.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Nine seconds.
Yes.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
No.
Then what was good about it?
Don't go.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Let's go...
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Okay.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
What?
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Bye, sweetie.
Go ahead.
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
It's not opinion.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
I had no idea she was this good.
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
I'll wait for you till seven.
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
Uh-huh.
What?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
I don't wan to discuss work.
I knew what you meant.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
Don't you work here?
Walter can I ask you something?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Look at the size of it!
Let's see it.
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Hi Walter.
I know what it is to be ignored.
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Walter...I can't believe it.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Hi Walter...
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
I wonder what his deal is.
Man this is heavy!
Walter, what are you doing?
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
H-have a seat?
Well...why murdered man?
You didn't mean to what?
A show..how soon can we go?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
I also saw the girl give you this.
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Police officer.
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
I- don't know what you're talking about!
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
I saw your...cat.
Maxwell.
You don't have to do anything!
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
I don't think this is gold.
Nice to feel needed.
Don't grab me, okay?
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
I'm fine.
I... feel.... pretty.
Excellent.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Do you know what time it is?
What show is this?
What'd you dream about?
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
Will you guys shut up, please?
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Why'd you come back?
Come again?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
That's me.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Beverly Center.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
I was a slave.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
None of your business.  God.
Wait a minute.
All right.  What do we do now?
Meet me at this address after school.
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Uh... gym.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
But you threw a knife at my head!
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
What!?!
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
There isn't time.
No THX.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
Come one, that was so weird.
That is so cool.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
I haven't seen him tonight.
So very much.
I can't!
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
What happened?
I never thought of that.
They'll kill us!
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
And the January Semi-formal --
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
You said "Crash".
Yeah maybe you're right.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
How was that?
How ya like that?
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
I'll tuck you in.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
I think you're real cute.
Well I guess this is it.
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
Who are you?  Do you have a job?
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
It's possible.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Why not?
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Ninety-three miles an hour.
God bless you.
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
I got him on the knee!
Don't bump me.
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You missed the tag!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
He did know.
How come you don't like me?
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Can I ask you something?
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I'm going to the Show.
Settle what?
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
Crash Davis?
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
Step outside, pal.
I don't believe in fighting.
Take the first shot at me.
She's playing with my mind.
Who you calling a "boy"?
I gotta go now, Dad.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
He walked eighteen?!
Well, I'd rather not say.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
You were wandering around.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
Oh, good.
Okay.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
Dad!
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
Yeah.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
...very difficult to get in.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
My wife?
Okay?
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
...hundred yards further down the road.
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Hello.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
Seven o'clock?
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Hello.
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
Half of everything is mine.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
We need this guy.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
I-I'll do it.
I'm going to go powder my nose.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
Right?
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
With the money.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
You're lower than a dog!
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
You threw it away?
Oscar wants you to call him.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
I wouldn't -
You are not threatening me anymore!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
...Well, I've got a large family.
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
It won't happen again, Sam.
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
...worst possible time for me.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
He won't let me in my own house!
And here. Here.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Leave me alone!
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
And I mean... that's no good.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
Get the fuck out of here.
Great.
...same outfit.
Come on.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Yes.
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
He's sittin' by the phone -
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
He's here.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Don't know.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
How you doin'?
My fuckin' head.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
I know, but that's enough.
Take it easy, though.
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
Women, huh?
Selina, are you okay?
You're kidding.
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Yeah, this is better than rape.
What a "drag."
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
You think so?...Selina?
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
Hey, you're anti-male.
Yeah, she's okay.
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Nothing. How's your hand?
You are...
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Maybe.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
Say something ...
Are you guys all right?
What's this?
Lady, don't let him do it!
How do we get back to the freeway?
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
That's your "rep."
I thought you said you could handle him.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
Any minute.
Lady, try making some sense.
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
Don't lay this on me!
Who?
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
I'm with two friends now.
Stop throwing names at me.
What do they need her for?
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Hey drop it, okay?
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
Do you know what's in that box?
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Yes sir.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
At least one.
You timed that beautifully.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
Who's in back?
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
What's that supposed to me?
You were at the Emerald that night?
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
That's a reasonable possibility.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Who are you working for?
Twenty percent.
Where do we meet?
What time frame have you got in mind?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
I don't know what you mean.
We're waiting on you.
It's in the process.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
Yeah?
Yeah?
What does it take to kill you?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
We're gonna get there first.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Why are you picking on me for?
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
I already called for an ambulance.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
So let's call this the usual.
You could always make it up to her.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
Just cut his hair, you know.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Good thing in a man.
Thank you.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Sure, Dave --
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
Do you mean that?
Someone recommend you?
No.
He's getting up.
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
You want to know how I kissed him?
Are you jealous of him?
What would he think?
Do you miss him?
But you can t stay, you know that?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
What does that mean?
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Tell him it hurt --
Come on, Dil --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Kind of wish I didn't.
Happy now?
What?
Don't.
Come on.
Shouldn't be, Dil
She own you, Jimmy?
You want to make me look like him...
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Come on...
Good-bye, Dil
Your soldier.
You killed my Jody
More endearments.
Love me.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
What's Fergus?
She was --
Yes. Now.
Not if you go.
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
Did you give him it?
You don't know that.
Leave us, Judie.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
Eddie and Tinker died.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
And what if I say no?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
You a handyman, Fergie?
Dil!
Why would you do that?
Back in a minute, Jody
Why?
So it was you all the time.
Thank God for that.
Hope not.
Eat something, would you?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
What's that?
Well, I could say the same about you.
What makes you think that?
They won't let him die.
What do you know about my nature?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
Why not?
No?
She your wife?
I got sent.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
See? I was right about you.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Do you?
Depends on what you believe in.
Is it bad?
You liked her?
Don't know her.
See if she's all right.
What?
What if I did?
Not here.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Oh, come on!
Oh!
No -- I guess not.
Oh, you should see your face.
You don't look so bad in this light.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Ours.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Oh.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Café.
Steal it how?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
It's Charles!
No.
Around one.
Bartholomew?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Oh.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
How long do you intend -- ?
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Not my room!
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Why can't you be serious?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
No sense messing up the streets.
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Yes, I know.
What? Assassinate somebody?
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Yes.
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
About how wealthy would you say?
Is it all right?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Of course it is.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
How's that?
Good for you.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Is your husband with you?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Come on. You can't stay here.
What's going on?
I'm still having trouble with English.
What are you doing in here?
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Go on.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Who is it from?
What is it about?
What's he up to?
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
Good.
She's my daughter, Tom.
is there anything you do?
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
Hi honey.
We're seeing all the signs in town.
Well?
What are you doing?
St. Michael's.
She was murdered?
Can you get inside?
No, you couldn't.
I know where you're going.
Pay no attention to me.
I am.
Me? Why me?
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
No! That's his table.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
No!
I promised I'd go right home after school.
You heard about that?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Why?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
Are you coming to the party?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
Jody. Wait.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Where are you going?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
Wait.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Who?
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Yeah.
You ok?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Now don't be nervous.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Oh...
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
Great.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Uh, huh?
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
You want cash?
All right, then how about this?
Damn.

Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.

...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!

Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Ho, ho...
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.
Aw, shit

You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
I don't want you to come anyway.
Oh, shit!
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
Okay.
...did you?
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
Yeah.
Robert Del Rio?
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Listen, Arlo...
Whoo!
Listen, Arlo.
Arlo, shut up.
Okay, here we go.
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit.
We!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.

Come on.  Come on.
Sorry.
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
Who put the big hurt on...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Oh!
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?


Well, that just about figures for today.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
...take my sorry old truck.
...here.   Mason...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
Listen, deputy.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Yes, sir.
Doc-...
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
Now listen to me.

You look fit...healthy...
...-ple.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
Do you know what'll...
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
Hit him.
Hit him again.


Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
Dennis!
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Iced coffee.
Quite a getup for jacking...
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
...to die for a country that's...
...the river.
...and unharmed, de-...

No.
And don't give him any ice cream...
...somehow.
Uh, we both like to fish.
Ah.

Video lock.
It's after five...
Rangers.
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.

...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...


I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
Mason.  Mason!
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
So you don't remember...
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...public drunkenness....
...beer.
...stole a truck under arrest.
...on the other end of this phone.


I'll stay here and secure this position.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
They're calling it an accident.
None.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
What about her?
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
Haven't the faintest idea.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
They don't kill a guy for that.
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Yes.
The apple core?
Hello, Jake.
Thanks, Lou.
Looking for someone.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
No. It was an accident.
Isn't that your number?
Absolutely.
I know what he says.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
No.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
No. I went riding rather early.
Mr. Gittes.
Is there anything else you want to know?
K... Cross.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
That dam is a con job.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Know him?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Maid's night off?
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
The Albacore Club.
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
She's too upset.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Did you get some sleep?
Going somewhere?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
Walsh here?
Sophie.
Where'd he go yesterday?
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Who?
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I don't understand.
Have we ever met?
Never?
Yeah.
Come again?
The L.A. River?
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
He did or he didn't?
Apple core?
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
So he says you sent them?
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going.
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt!
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
How's school?
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
You understand now? You see it clearly?
I don't care. I'll wait.
Elena!...But when...
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
My husband...you know him.
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation...
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane -
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..."
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Sixty-two thousand -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Is it good?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Let him finish, Charles.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
I know that, Emily -
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
What's funny now?
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
Where's the soap?
Where's the towel?
A chicken?
A rooster?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
Is that what you want to do?
Yes -
Would you sing for me?
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I won't let you go.
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
Impossible!  Impossible!
Oh, yes, sir.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
I mean I've got a job for you.
Yes?
What?
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie -  Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
I'll sign those papers -
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
What's this?
Beats me.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
You can hold me down.
So where is he?
You're kidding.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Well... kind of, sort of?
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
You're serious. You want to date again.
You work in a market, all right.
Sang.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
I'm serious.
Then who operated the store?
With this guy locked in?
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
Are you open?
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
So?
You're late.
That's what I said.
What smells like shoe polish?
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
Yeah.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
She's in here?
What's he looking for?
Perfect dozen.
What's a jizz-mopper?
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Vermont?
Why'd you apologize?
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
Don't yell at me, pal.
At least we're stuck here together.
Design major.
Are you gonna lock the store?
Helluva game!
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
You know what Sanford told me?
Why not?
You hardly knew her!
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
You were saying?
An embolism in a pool.
Broke his neck.
No!
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
I can't fucking believe you!!
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
Jesus!
Please, get the hell out of here.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
You're happy?
You're happy to get a fine?
You're kidding.
She said she did all the work.
This life?
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Lovely story.
Why do you say that?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
I'll call you. Let you know.
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
What?
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
Go open the video store.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
Oh... Can I help you?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
The white kind.
Actually, it is kind of rough.
Yeah, but...
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
At least they weren't lit.
Why did you agree to come in then?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
What the hell was that for?
Three?
He requested this?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
You had to tell him.
What did he say?
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
What are you talking about?
I didn't do that!
What part of Russia?
I think the lady called it.
Feel that.
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Willam!
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him.
I will. Take it easy.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
Surprise me.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
Where are you, Walker?
Glad you could drop in.
I'm coming out!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
What are we going to do?
I'm going with you.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Two...
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Do you see them yet?
He knows it well.
You can stop right there.
And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
Hello, Gabriel.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
And I can't leave.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
Let's be creative.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
A simple yes or no would have done.
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Can you see light?
No luck?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Take the rope.
What about you?!
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
He never hurt anybody.
On top of the peak.
Then where the fuck is!
You're looking at him.
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Get off my back, Qualen!
Don't give him anything.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Man against nature, right Travers.
This way.
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
Is it set?
What's the code, Travers?
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
Great, sir. Great.
Yes. They want to help.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
It's alright, thank you.
Do you feel that way now?
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
What crime did you commit.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
Where is he now, sir?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
Surprise?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Let me get up.
Blue eyes?
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Something like that.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
I was quite enjoying that.
You're keen on music?
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
Carry on, Chief.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Yeah... Pete the English.
Moloko-plus.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Hullo, son, how are you?
How many to a cell?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
Go ahead, say it.
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
Annie...it's Max.
Max, the cab driver!
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
Remember what you played?
The crowd had to dig it.
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
What?
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
Something going on?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
I got caught up at work.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
You're kidding me.
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Why not?
Like what?
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
You listening to me?
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
Are you breathing?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
I don't know any Rwandans.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Another collateral.
Show up for what?
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
In case he asks.
Paid sick leave?
Would you have called her?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
It's what I do for a living.
There you go...!
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
You're going too fast.
Slow the hell down!
Well.  That was brilliant.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
She must be some girl.
I was only going one way.
Look, I'm sorry --
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
You going to warn him?
You think I'm crazy.
I better get going.
What was your horse's name?
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Yes.
That's it?
You okay?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Equitation.
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Who are you, Jerry?
That was him.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Murdered?
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
You look great.
My father's house.
Is that what they told you?
I don't understand.
Back where?
How'd you get the picture?
Liza?
Geronimo is down.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
A dog.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
It's okay.  I'm game.
Night after that?
Which way did he go?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
We've lost contact.
There's no plug to pull.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
Dr. Arroway --
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
What is it?  What's happened?
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
Got a bogey, boss?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
Dr. Cullers?
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Could we hear to China?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
You're not real.  None of this is.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
So who -- what -- are you?
Can you show me?
So we passed some kind of test?
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
What's that?
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
I'd say this is slightly different.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
But what about your research -- ?
Ellie -- are you okay?
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
I don't think so.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
I read your book.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
So.  The final countdown.
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Here's the Patrol.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
You can't do that!
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
Lemme see it!
A cold drink? Okay?
Well, whatta we got here?
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
But, Luke...
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Kick a buck.
But -- but --
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
Stop that.
He'll never make it.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
I hate this...
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
I want to die.
I can't, Andy.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
You bastard!
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
He was lying.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
Where is it?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then...
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
But it's a different m.o.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Maybe you should...
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
Tell me what to do!
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
They all have one...
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
Just get out of your vehicle...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
It's none of my business anymore...
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Snotty neurotic bitch...
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
We could use a little help.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
I just got here myself, Susan.
He's not treating her right...
We were together six years, sir!
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
There, that's better.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Have you seen it?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
Do you find him attractive?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
Can you drive?
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
You're kidding.
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
What's up with you?
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
What's all the dreck?
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
But what am I going to do?
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Oh no.
Mom, please.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
I haven't had a crush since I was
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
Letty, you should be in bed.
Yeah?
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Guess which hand.
Guess.
For a price.
Shocking, huh?
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Furnished?
I love your apartment.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
How may I help you?
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
Can I put these here for tonight?
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
I don't think so.
What are you doing?
Yes, I suppose so.
Getting back.
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
All tapped out.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
Zero.   That's all I know.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
Oui.
You've already robbed the safe?
Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
Hopefully no one.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
I'm going to kill him myself!
Besides, we don't know the city and--
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
All right, knock it off.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Guns.   Can you get them?
Don't bullshit me.
I just thought that--
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Everything.
The map said to go left.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
When we get to the next corner jump out.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
No.   How much?
Going somewhere?
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
-- I want to be Elvis.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
Give it to me, Sami.
No.   It's mine.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
You're not helping.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
Algeria.
Did she break your heart?
Who's gonna see it there?
Can't sleep?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Who are you?
Do you think you are a real master?
And if I use them to kill you?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
Please sit.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Here you must be in proper attire.
Where is he now?
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Never!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
No, not yet...
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
Don't you want to see her again.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
I'll look around and catch up later.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
But the sword could be in his compound.
And you're gonna tell me who.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Talent. Hi.
You buying?
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's just the dope, don't worry
What's going on...?
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
I wish to possess what you have now.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
You'll be alone.
That thing is poisonous.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Nothing.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
Excuse me. Excuse me!
You've read The Fountainhead?
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
I never said that.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Thank you.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
I'm busy.
Sure. Have a good night.
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
What?
I don't.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Am I bothering you?
You know what? I don't take it back.
Hi.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
The football stud?
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Are you for real?
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
That was cool.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Did you hide the letters?
If that's what you call it.
It's like a secret society.
What year are you in?
I'm sorry that was out of line.
I was just kidding.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
I like it better when I'm on top.
Where are you going?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Whoa!
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes.
She bought it.
Where is she?!
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
What do you mean?
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Sorry.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Why not?
Loser.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
Any day now.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Who are you spying on?
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
No, tell me.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
What about her?
Ronald? That's crazy.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Right after we played backgammon.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
Oh, hello.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
What are saying, darling?
But where did you get it, Amy?
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
The Farren house
Irena.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
Did you hear the child out?
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
Where did you get it?
Hello, Amy.
I got lots of presents.
Why didn't you run after them?
No, I didn't.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
What'd you get for Christmas?
Will you be friend for always?
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
May I pet the deer?
But why?
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
I wasn't singing to myself.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Because it can't. It's dead.
The Headless Horseman --
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Good night, mother, good night.
Let the child stay.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
Wow your body's really hot.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
How's the rest of your health?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
My shrink says he's not so bad.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
Do you really need these?
Where are all the mediums?
And he was ripped limb from limb?
No, did you fuck him?
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
At least your PMS is over.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
So where's this infamous arm now?
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Get rid of him!
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
You expecting someone?
Peter knows something.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
What choice do we have?
About Benito.
Hello?
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
It's a matter of life and death.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
You wanna get some coffee?
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
What are those?
Everything okay?
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
What happened?
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Your breasts feel larger.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Hello?
Go away. I might hurt you.
Peter I love you too but...
Be careful!
Here's a towel.
I ate a guy last night.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
See he was cheating from the get go.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
What?
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What kind of animal?
What's he doing here?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
Police.  Nobody move.
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
Iím your new assistant.
You typed this report?
They didn't have faces.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Water?
Your name is John White.
Bad dreams?
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
It's a trick.
How do you know I'm innocent?
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
How do I get there?  Tell me.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
I'm not certain about...
Dave...
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Fine?
Die, you pond scum!
Don't call the Vice President!
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
We think so.
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Nobody's got clean kids.
You're kidding.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Dave!
President vetoes works bill?
Alan...
Yes, but I wouldn't...
What are they?
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
The Fidelity nonsense...
They re not my attack dogs.
... Sometimes they do.
You ever think back to how you started.
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
Really?
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
You ever use it?
I was waiting for that jack.
Well...
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
You bet.
I care about the homeless.
Look.  If there was some mistake...
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
You're leaving?
How were you gonna get home?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
I know. I'm sorry...
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
His madness....could be from shock.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Curse?
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Step up here, Tyler.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
I don't know.  I don't get it.
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
Oh God, it's over now!
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
Don't stop.
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Who else was involved in this?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
Who's in?
Charlie...
Nuwanda, what is going on?
What happened?
Don't stop.
What are you doing?!
Hello?
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Knox, I don't believe this!
Chris!
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
God, if Chet found out he'd...
I have to go home. Chet might call.
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Yes sir.
Very good, Mr._?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
Father!
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Look at this.
What is it then?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Todd, what's the matter?
Oh..
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
Put more into it!
You the Captain?
Who are you?
They are...they are everywhere.
Right here...middle of nowhere...
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Maybe we lost them.
I'm not staying here!
What other bunch?
I'm not a thief.
What is it?
It's not them...it's it...
Finnegan...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
What the hell does that mean?
Check it out!
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
Nick's going?
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
It is not!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
Tell him, Vince!
Let's go!!!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
That's new, isn't it?
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
I have to go.
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
You are his friend.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Hey, Nick...
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Not so good.
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
Linda, what's the matter?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
How are you?
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
What are you doing?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
You can do it, Sal.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
I just wait. You know?
What do you think about?
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
No way. No fucking way!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
See you Monday.
What's that noise?
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
It's Merle, Sal.
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
You're full of shit!
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
You're working a partner on this.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
You sure?  I can help you.
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
How then?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Married?
Yeah.
Hey, I'm eating.
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Rip Van Winkle.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
You be careful.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
You never want to find out.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
Who are these people?
Gee -- that Fair --
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Howdy, Jabez.
Say ... about the interest ...
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
She couldn't be gone!
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
What's the matter with you?
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Yes, why shouldn't it?
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
Coming along, Jabez?
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Why of course --
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Well -- what are we going to do?
Your butter money?
Mary -- it's gone.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Mary -- what would you do?
We must go on home, Jabez.
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
You'll never change -- will you?
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Mary --
Mary --
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
I want you to fix these fish!
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
Hans, he killed by brother --
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
Hans.  Your Hans.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
I...have a request.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Yeah?  What's the odds?
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
What's going on?
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Hey, don't take the car!
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
What guns?
How are you doing?
So... that sure is something.
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
That's it.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Yeah.
I don't have a choice.
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Yeah... yeah.
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
You try calling the police?
What kind of things, Leon?
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
Yeah.
Who's this?
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
Sonny-boy, one word?
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
Okay, give us the women.
Calm down, you're not ...
He wanted to kill me!
Well, what were you doin' back there?
I want to talk to him.
Howard, give him the keys...
Now, you -- what's your name?
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
Do you think we can turn it on?
You like me?
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
Yeah.
Mister Mulvaney?
Are you a lawyer?
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
Did you always call him Junior.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Goddamn women...
... The bodies out the door.
We won't have to.
To show that we're negotiating.
I never been up in a plane before.
They're trying to come through the door!
Sal?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
What's wrong?
Okay - you got your one.
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
We can't stay here.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
And if you can't deliver them?
Morning.
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
Where are we going?
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
I've already formulated a plan.
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
Cunt.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
What the fuck is your problem? Bitch!! <b> INT. SOPHIE TROMAS MANSION -- KITCHEN -- DAY </b> Domino is loading her GUN at the kitchen table as Sophie serves breakfast. Domino wolfs it down.
Can you tell?
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
Many times.
Where is Domino?
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
I don't like anything else.
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
And I--we--want some Black people up.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
Make it plain.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
Mookie.
Hurry up and get dressed.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
How many you say?
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
WAKE UP!
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
Sweet Dick Willie.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Mookie, if your friends can't behave, they're not welcome.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Mookie?
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Tina, you are too slick.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Feels good.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Just coolin'.
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Yeah.
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
I love you, my brother.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
I know this.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Then we could try something else.
Pop, stop lying.
The both of youse, shaddup.
Pop asked you.
No, I'm not it.
You're it.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Excuse me?
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
HARRY? Are you okay?
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Your mom made a move on me.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
Where did you learn that word?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
Owww.
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
I kinda screwed things up.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
But-
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
I... found that rock.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
Wait, wait!
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
What?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
So can I come along?
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Why ith dat newth?
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
That's my boyfriend.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
You really are a pirate.
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
Obviously.
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
It's a surprise.
The evidence of what?
Where is it?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
My Lord!
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
So, this is Leto the Just...
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
The Water of Life.
The Voice again.
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
Uh, beg to differ.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
No.  I don't work here.
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
Bela, what happened?!
What's in the needle?
Bela, are you ready?
You'll be sitting on the right.
What is this place?
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Don't worry.
Last night was quite a romp.
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
You really think so?
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
Wow.
Edward Wood, Sir.
H-how'd you know?!
I don't understand.
Will he be okay?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
How long have you been doing this?
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
It's a damn good role.
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Dolores, wait!
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
I kinda need it now.
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
Tor, I should be getting home.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
Those assholes.
I can't get it to go up.
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
You're sure this is gonna work?
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
I thought this was a group effort.
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
How's your mother?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
So?
You know what would be great?
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Where are you going?
Mr. Pekurny.
Al!
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
He had girlfriends!
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
Eddie...
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
I can't?
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
Hey, Lou.
Are you sure about this?
You do though, you look great.
What do you want?!
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Really?
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
I'm making a tape.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
You brought the girl!
You know what your problem is?
You don't recognize me.
I was in jail.
Check forging.
Mm.
We don't have foibles.
Yo --
In love?
what?
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
Larry?
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Tracy.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
So what brings you here?
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Where to?
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
What is it. Tammy?
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
points at the motel.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Hey Yeah?
And she's super-nice
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
She's doing this to get back at me
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Merry Christmas.
How'd she meet Patchett?
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
Do you enjoy it?
But you did it anyway.
Look.  I want to see you again.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Will you work for me?
Give me one minute.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Was it... a rat?
Where are we going?
One in six.  Where's the girl?
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
You expecting problems?
Bud...
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
She's fine.
Are you Pierce Patchett?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
That's right.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
You're wrong.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Ed, I want confessions.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
You're the key witness?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
It's a simple question.
So what's the point?
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
What's on the call sheet?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
On what evidence?
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Not a word.
You're back, boychick.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
Shut up!
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
What'd he give to you?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
I just gave him my card.
I'm doing a transfer now.
It is?
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
Did you call anyone?
What'd I tell you?
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
None of your business.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
That is one ugly sunrise.
Here?
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Fuckin-A.
Drive.
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Who's calling?
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
What size?
I think she'll like this very much.
For that matter, I think you will too.
Yes?
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Anything at all?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
Uh-oh.
Who did you work with to get the--
He's got his priorities?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
Good.
Are you sure you're safe?
It's really over?
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
It is fish.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
Rachel--
I can't.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Hey!
What's his name?
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
Yeah.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
No, but they took my blender.
That's what I want to talk to you about?
He's heard that it's escalated.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
I don't know!
No, I--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
I'm sorry, man.
Yeah?
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Tell me about it.
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
Yeah.
Was Zavitz in trouble?
You think there was a connection to--
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
Who?
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
No sir.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
You felt obliged to.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
Shall we be all right?
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Will you please come in?
Don't.
Say you're sick.
Arabic?
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
It hurts too much.
You're wearing the thimble.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
Have you seen Katharine?
It's Geoffrey under this.
If I could just see some identification.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
I was talking about the girl.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
Or was it Toronto?
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
What do you want?
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
What if I told you he did this to me?
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
Irving Berlin.
Top Hat.
Hana tells me you're leaving.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
What did you say?
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Could I have a cigarette?
He needn't disturb you.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
That's a different dress.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
For my hair?
So I follow the wires?
No. But he hands them over.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
This is hot!
Will you come with me?
He's gone, hasn't he?
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
Pardon me?
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
What's happening?  Am I needed?
Katharine!
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
Meaning--
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
Don't overestimate yourself.
Why are we speaking Chinese?
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
You disappeared.
Are you...okay?
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
I didn't expect you to be so...
I know.
It's a fake.
But--
What the hell do I do now?
What the hell was that?
Motorcycle.
Those are my clothes.
You stole my luggage? You--
That's entrapment.
I don't believe this.
And--
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
And good morning.
Nice spot.
Only a week?
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
On what? Another job?
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
I didn't mean to get personal.
I trust it's your size.
You bought this for me?
Thank you.
We're working.
One, two, three...
You can't be too careful.
The big job.
Oh my god, I thought--
What about the rules?
What's that?
Got it.
So how long till we do this?
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
There's always a surprise.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
How do I look?
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
The sign of our partnership.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
What's wrong.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
Gin, really.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
Oh, it is.
It's too soon.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
Call it an expression of trust.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
See you.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
250,000?
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
What's she doing here?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
What's chromium?
The judge came up with a number.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
At least they made an offer.
You think there's more?
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.
Hey.  I like working with you.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
How dare you take that away from me.
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
And if you had to guess ...
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Why not?
I did.  Both.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
When'd they file the demur?
How many counts?
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Ross.
You come to the right place.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
PG& -- Are you sure?
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
No.
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
What're you doing?
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
You're not nothing, Erin.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
About this.
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
They up?
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
Dr. Paulsen?
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Yes, My Lord.
He will learn patience.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
... Luke, you must not go.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Barks a blue streak.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Howls.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks his concern.
Yeah ...
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
Mine, mine.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
I think we're in trouble.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
I don't know what he's talking about.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
You don't look angry.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
There's something out there!
Are you crazy!
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
What are you staring at?
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
No thanks.
About what?
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
What'd you say?
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
I have followed my feelings.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
I don't believe it.
That they are.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
Do you have a name?
What are they doing here?
Go easy, Stevie.
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
Primitive?
Who's that?
I thought he was, but he came back.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Shit.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Get this crap out of me.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Not you?
She's in the green.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Location.
Stop the damn car.
Me too?
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Don't follow me.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
All of us?
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
Yield. I have the advantage.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
He can be no other.
You saved me from the arrow...
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
Excalibur! Is it true?
At your service, sir.
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
Very well. Climb up.
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
The oath. You didn't say--
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
What honey?
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Would you like some more coffee?
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Good morning Madame.
How are you today?
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
She used those words?
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
Where?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Pretty close?
About my daughter?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I didn't get you?
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
To begin with it could make things worse.
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
Where's Regan's father?
She...killed Burke Dennings.
Yes. He's already here.
Oh look at that.
Wait a minute you need two.
Captain who?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
What are you doing here?
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
Think you can sleep?
Do you like films?
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Another one. Had your lunch?
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Where's Regan?
You'd like that?
Quod nomen mihi est?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
And also with you.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
You're not my mother!!!
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Who?
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
I'm afraid.
Frankie.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
Just the same.
Honey ...
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Jack.
What's wrong with it?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
Count it.
Count it.
So we on tomorrow night?
You're their uncle.
It was an accident.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
You look awful.
Really.  You sleeping?
No, I mean it.
You gotta go.
So what'd we get her?
Yeah?
Nice, huh?
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
A gust of wind killed him.
I'm not unhappy.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
Get out of here!
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
See anything?
Hey, Frank.
Just a lucky guess.
Day.  Wednesday.
Have some more wine, Frank.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
All night?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Really.
How long you been at it?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
You saw wrong.
What're you doing down here?
Couple years.
A useless talent.
You don't know?
What channels it on?
Right.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
You're an hour and a half late.
How should I take it?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
So run a little longer.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
I sing now?
Ready?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
What-?
What do you think?
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Hey, we're connected.
Hey, will you look at that?
Some discussion.
I can't sing it anymore.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Thanks.
No.
All right.  Hold on.
It went well tonight.
And you don't?
Fucking.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
Can't sleep?
What'd I say?
You were good.
You were good.
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
Frank said ---
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
So ... ?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Yeah.
What kind?
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Big piece or little?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
You mean if I get sick?
Where am I?
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
What do you mean?
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
That's not the worst part.
I'm late for surgery.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
What do you mean?
How's Loomis?
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
Which ear was it?
Now what?
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
It can't be.  It's impossible.
What are you going to do, Castor?
They're too tight.
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
Just following your example.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
What happened to your big "assignment"?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
-- what?
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
What are you doing?
I'll deal with her later.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Her assistant?
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
Why Jack?
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
And I know people.
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Where do I go now?
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
Damn...
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Cmon Jack...
Like I said, it's a business deal...
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Yeah?  What do you need?
Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
You?  What about me?  Im working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Thats it?  Thats all I get?!  A glare?!
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
What're you talkin' about?
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
Something like that.
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
I dont care who you are.  Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Dont  go, Jack...
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
Are you okay?
Jack...dont even start...
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
Yes, Im fine.  Its just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?
Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
You mean this chocolate cake?
Cmon.
Thank you...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
I found it at an outlet store.  I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...
Heres the thing.  I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversarys good all day...
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
This place is a perk, Kate.
I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
I promise, Jack...
Dont get on that plane!
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
I mean...
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
Are you alright?
We had a tough year.
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
We're working as hard as we can --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
He's not responsive --
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
Back it down, Johnny!
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
And where do we think we're going?
I though we went over this.
You're on fire!
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
What is that <i>thing</i>?
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
They're ready for you, sir.
How's the IPO?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
Front page?
Ben's still out there --
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
But I'm not done with the machine --
Which was?
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Where do we stand?
What're you getting at?
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
Trip? Where to?
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
You must carry spare parts --
No need to get up --
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
About forty miles an hour.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
All in all, quite a canoe...
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
Come on -- it's no use!
What is it, Skipper?
Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
Can I see your license and registration please?
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
Well, okay, it's -
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
...Blood has been shed.
Three people. In Brainerd.
That's right. And we need more money.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
How ya doin'?
Yah.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
A subconscious-type thing.
You're not a C student.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Yah, but -
... I'm sorry, sir?
Yah, how much money was that?
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Yah!
...Dad?
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Yah, pretty good.
We're good to loan in.
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
No, see -
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Hiya, Lou.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Yah?
...Geez.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
No, that's okay.
Yah.
Yah, that's me.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Oh. Geez.
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
Gustafson's accountant.
Sorry - didn't copy.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
They announced it?
Your mallard?
It's just the three cent.
Yah, I guess.
Uh-huh.
And his wife?
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
You are?!
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
The dynamite...
And I saw you practicing this...
You're kidding.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Where have you been the last few weeks?
How did you find me?
That's the idea -- we split them.
It's for men.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
It's time for you to leave.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
What are you talking about?
I don't know ...
No, thanks.
Make sure.
Uh ... nah.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
I don't know.
Guy or girl?
Marla...
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
You got about thirty seconds.
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
Hello?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
Insurance'll cover it.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Go ahead.  Say it.
The fight.
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
You?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Promise you won't.
You want to finish her off?
What is this place?
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
I want to hear the truth.
This conversation...
You're too young.  Sorry.
Why do people think anything?
What about Marla?
...stop me?
...to let this happen!
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
I'm pulling the green wire.
One minute.
Can't you call it off... ?
Damn it!  God-damn it...
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
I'm doing this for us.
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Excuse me?
But, this is Project Mayhem.
Robert Paulson?
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
What about that?
Six duds in a row.
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Another premonition?
No!  It can't be.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
May we come in?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
Tell me again how it started.
Do you remember what triggered it all?
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
Whoa, nine months?
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Can I ask you a question?
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
What on Earth are they doing?
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
That's why I was there last night.
Is that something you're "feeling?"
That... him?
No.
4:25.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Stop the car!
Police are coming.
I'll remove him.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
It broke!
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
You guys are real... aren't you?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
Gettin' old, huh?
You read me, Brewer?
What's this?
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
This place is a trip.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
What's that?
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
How do we get upriver?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
What's the job?
Why me?
Where?
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
You think they'll find any?
Black.  No sugar.
This your stuff?
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
Will it hurt?
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
<u>What</u>!
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
He's not a moron.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
What are you two up to?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
What if I was a relative?
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
Where you comin' from?!
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
So how do we do this?
Now what?
Please don't hurt me?
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
... Do you know who I am?
The Little...
Him...?
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
I'm not married.
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
But I gave it to you!
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
I advise you to let us go.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
What are we about to do?
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Rayette.
Alaska.
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Well...
You want me to hold the chicken.
Oh.
No.
Robert...
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Yeah... I guess so...
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Like what?
Do you want some gingerbread?
Where is she, anyway?
It's none of your business!
I'm talking to you, Tita!
What have you been doing since then?
Why?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
You don't call that music, though.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
What?
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
No inner feeling.
I have to talk to you.
No, I can't...
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
Oh, for chrissakes...
Robert, I think you better just...
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
You better hold onto your tongue!
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
Not now, I'm busy
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
Whadja wanna see me about?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Why?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
You looking for somebody?
Yo, that's my girl.
My friend told me she lived around here.
How do I know you're not lying.
No.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Creasy, how old are you?
Fletch!
Hey you're really nuts.
What? What are you talking about?
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
So where do you know Alan from?
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Right.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Like when?
Jesus.
Can I get you something?
Oh my God!
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
Read this, please.
And what was that?
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Then he has.
He sighs.
Why are they after you?
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
Did you say cops?
She's cute as a button.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
Hi.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
You ordered it here?
I really should change.
Lunch...
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
What about his parents?
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
Who.
What are you talking about?
No.
I'm terrified.
They just left, sir.
I would, actually.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Who?
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Gummy and two cops...
I have some ideas.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
You'll have it.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
Not really.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Now that we've broken the ice...
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Actually, you may take it all now.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Did she tell you anything?
You're saying you need money.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Hello?
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
Zuzu, wake up...
Nice left you got there, jerk.
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Are you okay?
Gut feeling.
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
I tried to help you...!
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
What's fine?
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
The point?
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
How nice.
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
What?
Did you pick up the car?
Did they follow you?
Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
I got no music!
There's nobody like that on six.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
When ya go back on?
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
No, you?
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
The greaser with the blonde.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
You want the red or the white?
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
What are you saying?
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
It looks open on the other side.
Butch called.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
You ready?
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
Sorry 'bout that.
You call your son Little Chief?
29 years...?
What's going on?
How could this be happening?
You sound...ground up...?
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
What are you talking about?
On the job?
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
What?  What is it?
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She just died, your mother just died?
When?
Whatta you mean...
I'll warn them.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
He took your wallet?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Please, Dad, just do it.
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
My father didn't die in a fire?
I better give you my address then.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
Got a minute?
Are you a good cop, John?
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
Wife around?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
How do we do it?
Do you want a beer or not?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
Come on down!
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Are they following us?
Got any good ideas?
What're you doing?
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
What?
Darren, we better turn around.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
Whaddya mean?
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
No.  No, it's not...
What?
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
Where'd you get this?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Jason Voorhees is dead.
I gotta get back to work.
What's the problem here?
Jesus!
You're talking about my lady.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
What are you doing?
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Randy, c'mon!
Well?
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
Steven!
I guess not.
What's wrong?
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
I demand to know what is going on...
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
I heard you weren't coming.
I got you a present.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
You have to call the police...
I used to drive a taxi.
I opened thousands of brains.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
We must abandon.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
What happened eighteen months ago?
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
I think we Nought to wait.
Where are you going?
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
We're making too much of this.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
Shoot him.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
This could Pbe it.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Because we're completely mismatched.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Opening night?
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I'm willing to tell you my name.
What else?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
Your father said you might be here.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Alma Wetzel.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
Life is good.
This could be it!
What do you want?
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
I don't know.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
This could be it!
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
'm not worried about this kid.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Yessiree, Bob.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Yes.
This could be it.
Endearing.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
You know what.
He wears a disguise.
He's a very sweet man.
Home.
No one's waiting.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Yes.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Oww!
It is the work of untouchables.
Please! You're being foolish!
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
And Jinnah?
You're an ambitious man.
You've done me a great service.
I would rather march.
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
You almost sound like you believe that.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Twelve have a mission within the week.
At least it's nothing contagious.
What about this?
It needs work.
You really need that much?
It's not too late to back out.
A day or so.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
You really had other offers?
Is that all?
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
Where are we going?
Where are you taking her?
How are you, Jerome?
How the hell did you get here.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
Why don't we say we were together?
Of course I think about it every day.
So you didn't do it after all.
Why are we leaving?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
What's this, Lamar?
Flight got you nervous?
The doctor will give you something.
All it takes is a long arm.
What about them?
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
Where do you want to go?
What do you want for dinner?
You been okay?
I'll be okay.
I was going to fix you breakfast.
That doesn't hurt.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
What about the bank?
They checked in.
Who's she?
A man helped me open it...
He must have.
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
That would be the first time.
Okay?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
We better stick here till tonight.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Can we make it?
So what?
I don't know, airport I guess.
How long before this car's hot?
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Which way?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
You can trust him...
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
You knew what I'd do.
What's it got to do with you?
Well, he drove it into the river.
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Can I go now?
I want to talk to you later.
How were things between you and Frank?
It is. Honestly.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
Yes, while he was here.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
You coming to South America?
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Where would I find him?
How'd you know Albert?
It's not like that, luv.
What is it?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
What'll they do to him?
They bloody hurt me.
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
You coming back?
Eric. Eric Paice.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
Meaning what?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Cyril didn't like it, either.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Nasty way to go.
Ask me?
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
What's that?
Deadbeats all.
You did?
...this shit...
It's too...
Shoes, boots, yes...
For some sales pro...
Who?
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
The nurses?
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
You don't ax your sales force.
You...
...you're absolutely right.
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
We're just "talking" about it.
No.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
You're actually talking about this?
You're going to steal the leads?
He'd give me a job.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
You...
Dave.
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
They're going to come to everyone.
Why?
I, you know, they should be insured.
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I can't close 'em.
It is dead.
I am?
They stole...
Yeah.
The cops?
They're inured to it.
Will you excuse us please?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
Who used to say that?
I don't know, George, why?
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Who told you...?
Moss...Who told him?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
Mr. Levene...?
Would you come in here, please?
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Under him?
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
...ah, fuck this...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
Then put me on the board.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Can't do it.
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
Why I don't...
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
It was his idea.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
The check's no good?
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
When?
They took the leads?
Just now.
Fuck her...
You closed 'em today?
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
You're sure?
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
I'm sorry...?
Rick...?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Yeah.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Yes.
I've got to talk to you...
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
Who did she call?
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
You don't count Saturday.
What is?
I told you.
She wants her money back.
No.  She told me "right now."
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
What...?  Say the words.
You cashed the check?
Fuckin' asshole.
You hear what I said?
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
Your farewell to the troops?
Listen to me: They got some of them.
Where are you going?
Aren't you going out today?
I have the stuff from last year's...
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
On your pillow.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
Then why do you come to me?
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
You would risk your life for strangers?
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
I understand...
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
Count on me; that's my specialty.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
No.  I mean, are you sure?
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
I bet you can't guess what happened?
Within the compound will be fine.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
What do you mean gone?
You're going to talk to him now.
Goddamn it, where were you?
Mikey, I hoped...
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
Was it a boy or a girl?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
They are everywhere!
We've never sent this much with one courier.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Yeah, but don't worry.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
What the hell are you talking about?
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
Why don't you sit down?
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
You said you were Klingman.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
No, I meant lose his family.
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
Enjoy.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
This doubles my investment.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
I just left our friend in Miami.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
I wasn't going to try anything.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
You did not know?
You and he are not doing things?
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
What have you done with him?
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Or would you prefer a beer?
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
I liked it.  We all did.
No.
Did you kill anyone?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
So you had a wife?
Does that surprise you?
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
I never thought you were.
So we understand each other?
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Ah.  A philosopher.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
What did I tell you?  Listen.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
It's not like her.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
That only leaves the rest.
Is that --?
I never made it to Korea.
Why?
Just take off the fucking mask!
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
I'm up.  Thanks.
You coming, Boone?
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
Does the yardman come today?
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
I was going to take a swim.
Mr....Kay?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
What's with the fish thing -- ?
Fish.
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
Get out of here, Ray --
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
You have my word...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
What are you still doing here, Randall?
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
I'm on the move -
Not my girl anymore
When'd you get to town, Raines?
I guess ...
Got it ...
What's the matter?
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
Most of 'em are late-model...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
What does that mean -- ?
What are you doing back?
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
Sure -
Any more ...
Kip -- ?
You all right -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
You sure you're okay -- ?
Nah. It's a scratch.
"About what?"
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
He's gonna kill you -- !
You?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
You hear me?
Dad'd be proud --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Having fun, Kip?
You boost her -- ?
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Now what -- ?
What are we gonna do -- ?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
And here I am...
What kind of trouble -- ?
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
I go with you --
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
Hear you roar ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
What are you doing... ?
This time it's for real?
You think it can be done?
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
What about me?
How come ... ?
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You know what you got here?
Uh ... Randall -- ?
What? What happened?
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
Tell him. It's okay.
No. No. The guy from downtown.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
Go inside. I'll be right there.
The bag with the envelopes.
I don't care. Something's going on.
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
We've got to help each other.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Who's gonna do that?
I flushed it down the toilet.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
Don't worry about it.
What'll I tell Fran?
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
I gotta go home.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
She's sharp as a marble.
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
Thanks, Chuck.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
You and Morgan throw?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Yah, that is a nice ass.
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Chuck, let's go.
What's up guys?
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
I'm not sure--
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
I don't think I...Larry?
Will you take a check?
What class did you say that was?
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
What is it?
You're in a safe place, Will.
Where is it touching you?
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
Yes. Under two conditions.
Shall we start the, uh...
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Well, I'm sorry.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Good to meet you.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Hello.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
You're here quite a bit, then.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
Why there?
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
I could go for a Whopper.
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
I might understand that.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Yes, I do.
What does?
What is?
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
Where were you?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
Do you have a soul-mate?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
You want to read it?
Which one did you take, Will?
I just want you to know, Sean...
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Yeah?
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
I really don't 'date' that much.
You grew up around here?
How was that?
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
Promise?
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
How's it goin'?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
Take care.
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
Any gas?
Short fella. Pale face.
That's not your affair. Name.
Can all of you work?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
Government.
And you ain't ashamed?
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
She's settlin'.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
What's the matter? What's happened?
I never asked you!
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
Where you think you're going?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Pa! Shh!
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Mad, Ma?
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
Ma, you sick?
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
Got any more, Ma?
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
Looks like you done it.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
You can have this for ten cents.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
You mean get off my own land?
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
Then who *do* we shoot?
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
But what about this?
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
What's this?
Now you done it! You busted it!
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
Yes, sir.
You do not.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
So, what are you doing now?
It's me. Martin Blank.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
I want to be an actor.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
What's your business?
Are you going to the reunion?
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
You met people.
Watched television?
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Hello...?
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
He was trying to kill you, right!
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
I was leaving.
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Do you like the people you work with?
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
Like a union?
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Lisbon?
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Wait a minute--
Did you see Blank in there?
They blame you for the compromise.
In Detroit. This weekend.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
Don't forget your identity.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
What's a revival tent?
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
God it's great to see you.
Debi's house.
I have to get my head back into my work.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
How are you? How's business?
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
I have a way with animals.
Enjoy the day.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Thanks.
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Just make yourself comfortable.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Would you like to see that?
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
You buckled up?  You cold?
Did you ask him to come visit?
Did he mention it?
You got everything you need?
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
Well...  So you tried riding again?
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
Started what?
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
How was the dinner?
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
How are you feeling about work?
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Yeah, what?
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
They fired you?
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
Tom?
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
What does she do?
Can you drive?
Are you afraid of anything?
Sure?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
Hey, darlin'.
Long enough.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
Well, that'll happen.
What stuff is that?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Cool?
You think it's cool?
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Dead.
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
How was school?
What did we learn in school today?
Talk to me.
Crash Override.
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Two days.
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
Yes!
That's a nice score for a girl.
What the hell is going on?
What the hell are you doing?
It's too much machine for you.
It has a killer refresh rate.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Yeah.
We need your help.
Thank you.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
Alright, so what have we got?
There they are!
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
You look good in a dress.
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
Hello?
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
What?
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Murphy kid turn you down?
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
Thank you.
Purpose of visit?
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Brady!
Brady!
When did this happen?
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Why wasn't I notified?
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
I do.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
What?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Come on Rachel!
That's all the windows, Dad.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Hell of a night.
Where are you going?
132 to 133 this is 134.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
I am. Ben Meeker.
Is that him? Is that him?
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Where's the radio?
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Why didn't you wait for me?
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
What time?
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Annie, was that you?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
Get him out of here!
You locked yourself in.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
Go get me a beer.
My parents won't be back till ten.
I gotta go.
Yeah, sure.
Sure...
Is Annie around?
Okay. Later.
Can we watch the monster movies?
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
No...
Right.
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
I'm scared!
I'm not responsible, Sam.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
...any sister talk?
Oh, good...
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
I know.  It's terrible!
That's disgusting!
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
I can't resist.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
And it's just in one ear?
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Isn't that beautiful?
Oh!
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Is something wrong?
And you're in love overnight?
You bet.
I want one with you.
No!
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
How about something to eat?
Me?
...or films you must see or...
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Why?
Oh, yes, you have!
But you don't have any symptoms!
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Yeah.  What?
Oh, yeah?
Hi.  Where's Holly?
Do you miss Frederick?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Hi!  Hi!
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
How is everything?
Oh!
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
What are you talking about?
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
What?  You're kidding!
Ohh?
Oh, he's such a loser!
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Ohh!
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Hey, hi!
Boy--
Hey, what's the matter?
Oh, so loosely.
Well--
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Yes, you do recall, right?
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
It was a terrible evening.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
You're okay, though, huh?
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Well, what about me?
Really?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Oh!
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
And?
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
It wasn't my day.
...how are things at the Hospital?
...you...
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
C'mon, pal.
You want to get married...?
Then you tell me, then.
How crazy is that.
How was America?
...are they hard to get?
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
He escaped...
You give me whatever I want...?
...they're from Baltimore....
What reaction?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
No, no, of course not.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men
...unmarked hundreds....
Sir:
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>.
Give it up.
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
...yes.
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
I've left my <u>program</u>...
I require...
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
I came to pay my...
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
...which of us is free...?
The girl needs help.
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
What was it.  What was it, honey?
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
...my love...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Thank you.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"--
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today...
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
No.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Talia, don't go!
What are you doing?
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...
Fuck off.
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
She got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
I'm still on anti-biotics, I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh, I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one, I wasn't a mutant. Secondly, I...What are you thinking?
Sorry Veronica.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Things are going to change, Earl.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Guess who?
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
What are you doing?
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
There are no stupid questions.
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
We're breaking up. I am out!
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
This knife is filthy.
If you'll excuse me......
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
How do you turn the fucker off?
The bomb, asshole!
You know what I want, babe?
You going to eat this?
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
Bye.
Got an A, Mum!
He's the manager!
Come on, sit up.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
That's coming along well!
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
Fruit.
I think I'm dying . . .
This.
What?
I shall call him Diello.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Isn't it beautiful!
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Pitbull attacks.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Since what?
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
What's wrong, Trev?
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
What evidence?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
I thought you loved games.
Morgue...?
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Dreams?
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
Wait... what the hell is this...
It's not that kind of date.
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
Often, uh.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
We're all assholes, Bernie?
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
I...
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
Underbelly!
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Here.  Get off here.
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
"A little mistake"!
What is it?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
It's not unthinkable.
He lost a shoe!
Oh my God!  Bernie!
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
You didn't... get it on with him?
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Hey, c'mon.
Give it here, Bernard.
And the rent is okay?
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
As long as you keep remembering why.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Well, can I make an appointment?
Oh, great.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
About what?
I found a cent!
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
I could take a cab on the way home.
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
I know it's at the high end of our range --
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
Did you hear that?
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
What -- what are you doing?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
It's fun.
Are we gonna buy this house?
What did the thermometer say?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
Is it a king or a queen?
Promise?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
Anything from the bank?
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Where have you been for the last seven years?
You sure?
You?
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
Sing.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Thank you, Thomas.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
To ask her to dance.
Yes.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
You can go first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
How comes it your are not afraid?
Why?
You guys are from the British museum, right?
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
You're hurt.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
Why?
I'm just trying to place you.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
That makes you uncomfortable?
Why not?
On the back it has--
It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
Where will you go now?
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
Is there anything else you need?
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
You kept it?
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Talley.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
Jen?  Are you all right?
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
We're fucked.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
It's over.  We have to give up.
Then we might as well die rich.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I'll give you these people.
That you, Talley?
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
The cops are comin'!
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
What if it goes south?
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
No one's coming.
We can't carry him.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
Please get away from me.
Thanks for the shirt.
How can we get out?
That's not enough.
Is something wrong with Jane?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
It's right in front of us.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
What are you people going to do?
We've got to get those kids out of there!
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
Where are my children?
Where's your gun?
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
Marlon and Al....
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
Excuse me?
Who are you?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
Anything. Strong.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
We must go to the Diplomat.
Your police are at the gate?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
Very good.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
What do you mean George?
You fucking see that!
Lets go, Jock.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
There are no more rooms.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Our cards, please.
How much?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
Was there blood?
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Do something.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
Oh, my God!
What!
This won't do.
How can we help him.
You could leave, Paul.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
We have to have a plan.
Rutaganda's place?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Not yet.
Jesus H. Christ!
Oh, for chrissake --
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
You're not my list.
Melissa!
What?
Where is it??
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
'Less the place really is haunted.
What is it? What's in there?
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Why not?
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
-- you lose either way, Price --
This is the best we're gonna do.
Don't think it's even an issue.
What?
Then what the hell are we doing here?
Don't touch me!
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
What are you talking about?
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
-- wit...nesses --
I'm ready now.
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
What're you talking about?
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
I'll take my chances.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
It works.
Won't do any good.
Excuse me?
Pritchett: what is going on?
Please.....anyone....help me?
Sara...?
Damn it.
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
It looks delicious...
By freeing them.
Can you talk to her?
She's down.  Help her...
Look daddy!  It's empty!
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
Good night Angel...
Mommy!
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
No.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
What are you talking about?
Oh my God where is she!
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Are you all right?
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
What was she afraid of?
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
Keep talking!
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
There's something in there.
What do you mean?
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Hello?
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
I'll boil some water.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
How have you ... ?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
What ... What ... ?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
Joey?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
I miss you too.
Yes. 53
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
That was close....
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
Welcome back to Vinci.
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
The C.I. what?  God, no...
Oh Hudson...
I wanna know...
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
Bunny, not you too?
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
The Shazzammeter!
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
Well, I --
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Oh, is that it!
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
You mean you know about this?
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
...You son of a --
Muncie.
You can't print that!
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
Just got hired today!
I got big ideas, though!
Terrific.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Awwww, buddy --
...You don't?
...It is?
But, Buzz, you know I never --
Oh, geez.
...Yeah, go ahead.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
Well, frankly, I...
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
Not that way! Through the door!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
...adenoids.
Good morning, miss.
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
At the Houmfort.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Is this disease common in the tropics?
You're single?
The West Indies?
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
Where do you think you're going?
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Can't I take it for you?
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I told you.
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
I don't know -- I don't know--
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
The turkey in?
You're not going to --
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Grades?
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
Your toes cold?
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
But...
Thank you Janey.
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
You okay?
I saw you on your bike today.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Here you are.
What?
What do you mean?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Awesome sleet and rain.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
Where you going?
I don't ever want to see you.
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
You get in trouble?
Hello, Charles.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
And?
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
I love you.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
My partner...
You did your homework, Officer.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
Who's playing?
Not really.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
Eight years.
What do you want to talk about?
No way.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
Thought I smelled something.
I don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
Thought you might find that.
Down at the station?
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Wild card.
Your lips, they didn't move.
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
I have not spoken to him...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
Then blame the one who made her...
We want no quarrel with him.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
You made us what we are, didn't you?
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
Or her, or her - or any of them?
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
This is no performance.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
He can protect us, Claudia.
They would have killed you -
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
Diane!!!!
Let's call that a start.
You've just done it -
Did I hear a yes?
Take him.
Have you ever been caught?
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
You fool, what have you done?
Where are we?
We belong in hell.
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
Lestat - finish this -
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
No... You come back to me Louis...
I have to go now Lestat...
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
You said the slave had a crucifix...
Shall we go on?
But why did you tell her?
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Did he die in the fire?
You promise to care for her then?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
Stupid. Stupid.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
I thought you were out of town!
That was heart attack time, Karla.
No means yes.
He does work hard.
Oh!
I'm the King of the World.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
Nice move.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Julie...
What do you mean?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Ray, I can't...
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
Don't kill me --
Deep breaths --
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Come on, it'll be fun.
Ahh, that feels great.
Why? He can't help us.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
What's the matter, boy trouble?
What's going on?
Cool.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
Where'd Estes go?
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk 	he staggered.
I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Goodbye.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
Theodosia.
Your daughter is ill.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
You know that sound, Oliver?
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -
I have had command for the last time -
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -
But they're somebody's children.
Get that ladder up here.
Stand back.
You what? To save me?
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
I . . .
Where? I don't see a thing.
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Splendid! Is he sick?
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
It will?
Old college graduate now, huh?
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
Goodbye, everybody!
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
Hmmm . . .
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
George.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Violet Bick!
Well, what do you know  wife.
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look  if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
When?
All of it?
Now look, did you buy anything?
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Pop!
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
With coconuts?
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Do I look as funny as you do?
I'll take it. And then what?
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
When did you get back?
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Oh, Mary . . .
Mary! Mary!
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
I guess you forgot something.
Come on, you guys.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Get on the rocks!
Why not?
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
The lighthouse?
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....
I thought you said she was going with us?
You coming up on him?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
What is it?  What's there?
On your own time?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Chief?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
I'm going out there.
Where to?
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Wait a minute....
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
There is nothing to discuss.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Do you?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Do I have to talk to those two?
Mrs. Silvera?
Oww!
All summer?
I know what you're going to say.
What?
That you were fired.
What're you going to do today?
I'll give notice.
What're you doing?
Are you serious?
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
When?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Can I go swimming?
Can I go with you today?
I told you, remember?
How old is your cousin?
Terry!  You okay?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
Come on back up here!
Give me back my hat!
What about the others?
Anything.  Anything.
How much longer?
About damn time.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
You do everything your parents tell you?
Heading back?
You're going sailing.
Take me.
I want to go with you!
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
Wave to my son.
Be reasonable, please....
Go on, you're tired.
Go on, Doctor.
I'll need more men to look.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
What's wrong?
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
Where are you going?
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
Fine piece of engineering.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
Finally.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
Yes, you can.
What do you mean, we don't?
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
Come on!
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
Nobody told me.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
I'm sorry.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
I will.
You look like an orange worm.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Let's hope he knows that.
That's because I am the shark.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
Musclehead?
So, you just get here?
'Course they're also so rich.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
I'm a water-skier.
Well, I needed a cold shower.
This is where to be.  High and dry.
Herpes?
Sean, do you have herpes?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Take it up.
I don't talk that way.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Yes, there is goes.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Polar bears.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Look great, don't I?
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
Where are you going?
It sure is good to be home....
Make a list.
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
Turn it off....
Where have you been...?
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?
They won't kill it....
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
I want you to get out of the water....
Nothing out of the ordinary....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
You and Sean used to make....
It got him....
Flies the plane....
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're impossible....
I borrow it without telling him....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
I can't....
Grab your socks....
What happened?
Yeah....
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
Let me speak to Ellen....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
Money is money....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
How many?
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
What happened to Clarence and...?
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
You sure you've done this before?
How long have you known Hoagie?
Bring her to starboard.
Half don't...Bring her about....
I don't like it....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Shit....
You told me what?
Holy Christ....
What the hell are you doing?
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
Cow tipping?
Did you like that, Mama?
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
How about any guys on your staff?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
Yeah, he can go ...
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
You gotta stop smoking ..
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
What do you mean?
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
Why?
What do you want it for?
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Did I say he did?
I dunno what I can do to help you?
What about Citrine?
What exactly you doing, John?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
What does that mean, Sergeant?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Vehicle references.
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
No.
The elevator wasn't working?
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
Are you married?
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
Ross told me.
Has he got your aunt's address?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
He doesn't need my help.
What are you doing, Travis?
Who sought the warrant?
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Yeah, I guess I do.
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
So tonight she confesses?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
He's happy, darlin ..
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Don't ever stop fucking me!
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
I have to finish my job --
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
That took guts.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Hey you.
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Beer okay?
Truth?
Well.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
And I really don't know your noises yet.
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I don't like to give up.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
I heard.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
Oh, thank you.
What happened to Denver?
Not right now, Jerry.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
You love me now, don't you?
Is that your porty or mine?
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
I'll get you some quick work --
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
That's an answer.
I think so.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
How can I make your life better?
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
They do, my brother.
Hi.
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Do you think it goes all the way across?
...once-in-a-lifetime.
He says it's a bad idea!
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
What?
Young adult.
That's him. Thats Eric!
Eric! Are you here?
Udesky.
Well what?
PAUL!
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
How was your trip? Profitable?
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
He used to know me.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
You remember the sounds they made?
Know what this is?
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
Well that's good.
Amanda!
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
I'm not going, John.
Are you looking for a problem?
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
What are you guys gonna do?
What kind of gun is that?
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
What in Christ's name is going on?!
What is?
It's... behind... us.
What?
What are they?
Come on!
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
I think she's with Sarah!
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
Can you set up?
Oh, God.
Ian.  It's guano.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Give it more morphine!
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
Ask her.
What?
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
They are?  I'll be damned.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
Did I say jerk?
There you are.  Out you come.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
Okay, who's the jerk?
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
So what are you thinking?
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
Dr. Grant!
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
I'm going with you.
Come on, let's go.
No. We can't.
And scary.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
Alan, listen to this.
Dino droppings?
Faster, faster!
Yes?
Why not?
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Are they heavy?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
I threw up.
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
Straight-A brainiac!
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Where does he think he's going?
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Can't you stop these things?!
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
Let's go!
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
Don't do that!
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Other guy?
It's still on.
What happened?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Are you going to plead insanity?
You think that's going to work?
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
How long will he need to be asleep?
Cute waitresses?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
Add it to the list.
Where's he going?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
You know how to use one of those?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
My assistants, I presume.
Fine -- terrible.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
Will you do me a favor then?
It's my last and final one.
A true friend would do it.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
Do you?
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
All these in the last year?
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
He's grubbing for money, father.
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
I'm sorry ...
I can't imagine you crying.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Sure dear, yes.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Oh no, I don't think --
What about?
You remind me of my uncle.
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
It's kind of late.
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
The same as Jane McKenna.
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
Town Police.
We grew up together. Kids.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
You forgot the milk.
What about my orange juice?
When is mommy coming back?
Uh, huh...
Yeah?
Mom, I mean dad...
I'm sorry.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Is mom ever coming back?
See you in the morning light.
Yes?
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Was there Burger King?
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
Did you wish to?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Objection.
Objection!
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
And how did you find his work?
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
How long was that?
I was not a failure.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
I'm not taking him with me.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
What?
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.
You ever see her talk to the walls?
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
You're sure?
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
How many onions does it say to use?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
Thelma, if I die--
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
I do, now.
Where will you keep them?
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
And the United Nations? Surely?
Oh, no. Where will he go?
Your father had been very sick.
I will be back in a few days.
Do I have money?
How big is Tibet's army?
In the Pacific Ocean.
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
What is the size of our army, now?
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
Please, come in, so cold.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
What does the butter spot feel like?
Things change, Kundun.
Am I running away?
Tell me.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
Hmm.
You killed him.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
And what would he do come winter?
Keystone what?
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
You take care.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
<u>Jack</u>!
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
What?
And how would we neutralize him?
I'm okay.
He's gonna live?
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
It's too dangerous for--
That was an awful thing to say to me.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Sorry.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Really--
He's mooing.
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
It was... something meeting you.
No.
Are they feeding?
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
If you get a safe shot...
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
What?
With what?
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
What is this?
Hank!
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
They're coming right in.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
"- every day."
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
It's much better than your shoes.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
Reasonably so. Yes.
And the questionnaire...?
Ahhh... Why?
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
Horses - and sheep...
I - ran away...
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
Then tell me how.
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
Thank you, Clarice.
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Yes, miss.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
The Ottawa are gone.
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
And my compliments to you...
Where will we go?
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
My God, Alice.
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
What?!
Head for... for the white water.
I don't understand!
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
Got a reason to stay.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
What happened to you?
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
Sergeant Major!
Yes.
What is enough?
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
And?
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
That's an order!
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
You did good...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
I need more light on that, Four.
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
They know, don't they?
We're on backup air.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
The internal monitors read normal.
Excuse me, sir...
Oh, God, she's out there...
Charge set?
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Forty-eight hours!
If he had his blinkers on--
Bullshit.
What happened?
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
I'm going to try to remove it.
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
How is he?
Are you sure you saw something?
It saw us!
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
I thought this was a pub.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
I don't know what you mean.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
Son?
How long has he been in there, son?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
Who was that?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Where?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
And look what happened to that.
You what? What are you on about?
There's nothing in it!
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
Tom, this is our case.
Tom?
I will.
I think I would rather just turn them over.
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
Look. Go on, look.
What have you come as?
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
That makes it okay?
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
Charley Wade.
That's not the point.
Whole different story; isn't it?
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Same weight I always was.
Best part of the job.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
You've been in this house for a while?
Where'd he get all this?
Uncle Al--
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
PDA?
Well--
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Are we going to ever see your father?
Right.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Cliff--
You going to get married?
It's a .45.
So where does that put us?
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
I thought you were married!
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
Tell that one, Hollis--
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
Bledso
You thought any more about our murder?
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
Fellas.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
Sam--
Steve called for you.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
There must have been somebody.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
And my father?
I'm not open. We were just talking.
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Morning, Sheriff.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
So why did you come back here, Sam?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
Yeah?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
And are you afraid?
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
He's good.
Are they treating you okay?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
I can be very persuasive.
They were jealous of him.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
What did you find?
Stuff?
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
It's okay.
Don't look.
What about me?
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Whose is the car?
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
I like to know why things happen.
I can't let you in.
I want to see Swann face to face.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
The Puritan?
Harry D'Amour.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
They got here before us.
That's where we're all going.
He did something with the ground.
Can you do it?
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
Call me tomorrow.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
One question.
Nix! Nix!
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
Swann?  What are you doing?
You could still help me do that.
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Hello?
What do you do?
What did you study?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
I don't want to go home.
Did I scowl at you?
I don't remember.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
But, I'm mean.
Oh.
No one ever tells you that...
I know.
Four.
What happened to your toe?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
I'm going to miss you.
Charlotte?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Mr. Harris?
Lydia?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
Uh, no.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Like Japanese food.
Hello?
I guess she's busy.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Hello? Yes?
You wanna come?
I don't know what to do.
Hair stuff?
Do you think it's done?
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
It's amazing  there!
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
You'll do it?
You fucking bastard.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
So...we won?
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
Yes... and you are?
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
What's that got to do with you?
So...what did you think of the tape.
So what'd I miss?
And the point is?
What?!?!
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
Get up!!
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
No oxygen to the brain.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
He can see you Thursday.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
What do you mean by that?
That's not funny
Yeah, you met her?
There you go.
No I don't.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
So you're still breast-feeding?
I can take it.
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
What?
Careful.
That was nice.
You could make a career by telling me where.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
Damn, girl.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
I don't know sometimes.
Mom's going to hate it.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
I found you someone.
No.
They ever love you back?
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
Thanks, Sidra.
What's up?
But?
I know.
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
You ever think about going back?
I never knew a girl that could play.
I don't know.  A lot.
I don't like flowers.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
Hey.
Mulholland Drive.
Four.
When'd you get this?
What'd it say?
I can't be nice to a fan?
It's okay, little baby.
Forget Tonya Randall.
I won.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
You want to go talk?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Hey.
Can we talk?
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Least she had time for me.
What?
So that's it, just forget about us?
So...I guess I'll see you around.
Actually, I don't...
Who's this guy I always see her around?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
You asked me what was missing.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
So?
And what happens when you lose?
We should head over.
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
Still the man.
Where's your dad?
Later when?
Guess I should have been telling your father.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
I just told you.
What are you doing here?
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
What surery?
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
No need for braces, Donnie.
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Yeah, hey. Chad.
What the fuck do you want?
I don't wanna talk to you.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
GET THE FUCK OUT.
...Hello...?
uh...uh...What is it?
Wilson.
No.
Yeah.
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
The gentleman who came to the door --
Eight o'clock?
Well.
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
-- you the resident here?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
Diet Coke.
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
Doc it's Janet.
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Do you have love in your heart?
Is it real love?
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
I'm sick.
...please...
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
What is that?
I don't know.
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
He has Phil right now.
I need to sit down.
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
Get a girlfriend.
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
I would just want to clear some things up:
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
Where are you from originally?
And what did your parents do?
Why does that sound silly?
I wouldn'tve asked --
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
How long have you taken care of him?
Is he in pain?
Uh. huh.
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
You're just come in --
I am calm.
I don't have to answer your questions.
I live alone.
I don't know a loud crash.
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
You on any medication?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
No.
You want her right now?
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
Come home soon after the show.
I don't think I want that.
No.  No.
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I don't know....
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
Was it a call back?
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
Where will the money go?
What does that mean?
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
Linda --
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
Pink Dot.
Mmm.Hmmm.
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
Why didn't you answer those questions?
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
..sorry...
..sorry...
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
...what...?
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
I am preparing for a ball!
What is it, mother?
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
Wh-- Wha--
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
Three days.
Go on.
What you're asking is impossible!
He seeks redemption.
No!  Stop --
Pull them back!
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
And why are you so glum?
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
Coming?
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
Do I look all right?
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
D'Artagnan!
I heard your playing.
Raoul is everything to me.
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
What is that?
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Phillippe...?
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
Betrothed?  I think not.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
I was told this impostor was dead!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Where is Michelle?
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
You mind if I ride with you?
What the hell happened?
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
What did the six-toes have to say?
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
Are you alright?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Yeah?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
No...
And?...
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
I'm stranded out here.
Are you a regular there?
No.  It wasn't like that!
Don't you guys ever knock?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
What have we missed?
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
In thirty-five minutes.
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Is it weird?
Tell me now.
Get me a plane!
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
Parking permits...
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
Ride with me.
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Do you see?
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
It's Will Graham...
Can you read it to me?
In a holding cell.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
I don't understand.
Do you know something about that?
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
No.
If I were?
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Blue is cold.
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
Do you remember what you said?
Then why?
Is Crawford going with you?
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
Thanks for the lift.
Lt. Fisk said...
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
Are you gonna kill him?
How?
You went in the apartment?
What kind of coffee do you like?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
Why does it feel good?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
Andy?
Andy!
How long would they let me sleep?
They're having a laugh...
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
What was that all about?
You must take a little pleasure in it.
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
And all this will be for real?
You're not listening to me --
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
Each show is worse than the next.
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
Sir, do you have a problem?
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Are you at peace with your family?
Goals are important.
Excuse me, Andy...
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Can I help you with something?
Bob Gorsky.
A -- a tourist.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
He's gonna make it.
Weird.
That's the third white van I've seen.
What?!
You're two hours late.
You got the money?
Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
There's something about him, isn't there?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
... yes.
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Yes.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
What is he doing?
How long?
Who's coming for me?
Holy fucking shit!
No way, no way, this is crazy.
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
This isn't real?
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
I thought it wasn't real.
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
Hello?
Yeah.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
Who is?
And I know that's not where you want to be.
God...
What does that mean?
Is it?
That I would have to make a choice...
No, you... have to be.
What?
No, you're not.
No one has ever done anything like this.
Are you all right?
Can you fly that thing.
How?
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
We need an exit!
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
No.
Riverdale.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
May God be with you.
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Hey, come on...
Waddaya think?
You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
What do you mean?
Don't promise...just deliver.
Let's get out of here.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Don't you move!!!
Back so soon.
Oh great...hey - Winstons?
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Hey, shut up.
Disgraceful.
Oh Michael, look...
What's a'matter?
Charlie, this is business.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Take a drink!
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
"Francis Macomber."
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
It's still sick.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
I'm sleepy.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Scumbag--
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
Look who's talking.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
-- Black.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
I haven't been the father to you that --
Paillarde of veal.
...This shit's not bad.
And that?
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
Toast?  No...just the butter.
And what would that be?
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
I didn't say.
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
It doesn't matter.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
No.
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
What you then?
Can't, sistah.
I am.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
The Board is waiting.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
You think so?  How do you know?
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
Come again?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I came to see you.
Very well, I'll watch.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
Has her pain abated?
'To bed'?
Almost.
Thank you.
Well -- I --
Will it?
The 'coffee shop' --
I - uh --
Susan --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
When you go, I go.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Well, thank you for letting me know.
Good morning.
Sounds fair enough.
A 'deal'?
Bill --
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
Excellent.  What is it?
Truly - uh - splendid.
Uh-huh.
Dinner?  Absolutely.
About Susan?
I'm not hungry.
You are?
Thanks.
You're what?
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Which is what?
Those were my words, Bill.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
Are you giving me orders?
'The one' to do what?
What the hell are you talking about?
The 'question' --
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
Drew told me.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Don't get carried away.
Are you okay?
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
Are you relieved?
But what?
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --

Burt.
Amnesia?
So you're holding my calls?
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
No, let's go.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
You think you can bargain with me?!
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
Is that what your little note says?
Have I told you what this man did?				*
I wasn't helping you for money.
Sleep okay?
So I just take your word?
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
His name was Jimmy.
What do the police think?
Kill him.
Who?
What does he want?
What happened?
How?
What?
Don't talk about my wife.
Don't say another fucking word!
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
On the house.
My wife.
Beer, please.
You're the memory guy?
I don't know. I'm sorry.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Shut your mouth!
What the hell you want to go there for?
You don't know him?
Natalie? Natalie who?
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
Who the fuck are you?
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
I didn't sell -
Why?
I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
My wife wasn't diabetic.
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
You know, when we found your guy and			   * killed him.  That's right, the real John G. Over a			  * year ago. I helped you find him. He's			  * already dead.							 *
What cop?
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
Sal Maguda.
Oh, yeah...
Just came in.  She's still alive.
We're not certain...
You need to consider a few issues.
Sure.
So...?
How many?
Make it 40%.
We want it back.
The Keys?
I insist.
Like...?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
I forgot the napkins.
What's the best fortune you ever got?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Is this the protective male talk?
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Red light, green light, José?
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
Yeah.
Yeah?
What's our deal?
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
Where we meeting 'em...?
What do we got?
Eleven to seven he blows it.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Oh, good...
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
You sure?
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
You mean with the flowers...?
Okay.
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
This the load you lost a while back?
Must be some mess back there.
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
For money.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
What's in your socks?
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
You got a comb?
They wrong?
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
You're what?
Hey, what the hell you doing?
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
'Figgers.
Two kilos.
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
What?
Anybody bitten?
Where'd you get that limp?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
No, I'm not afraid.
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Just what?
...are you with the Consulate?
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Got a family back there?
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
Just Erich.
Feeling all right?
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
And you?
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
What?
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Just got some news on Bell.
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
What'd the Prosecutor say?
Lawyers?
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.
There's some weird shit here.
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
Wait a minute-
Is there a switch?
Can we get this car there?
He's special.
What are you doing down here?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
But the power...
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Which way?
We're no leaving you!
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
Honey, just leave it.
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
Great crowd.
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
No, Jesus, no.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
It worked before...
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
It bit you.
My God.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
I'm not much of a critic.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
You're very kind...
But what?
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
Then who did?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
To Misery.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
What things?
Could be the weight of the snow.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Newspapers?
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
I thought you were over it.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
I thought you were going to dinner.
Where is it?
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
Feel like pleading for your life?
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
Nyah!
What was the top bid?
Before we kill her or cure her..
Range is two kay.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How're we doin', then?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
I wouldn't do that.
Hola..
So where did I got right?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
What's the population of Seville any idea?
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
Just like old times?
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
Have you met them?
Where do I meet you?
I managed.
No.  Should I?
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
'Terrorists?'
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
I do.
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Only four more cars.
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Did we get it?
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
Where were you?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
What are you going to do?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
What are you going to do?
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Claire...Hey...
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
What kind?
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Why, may I ask?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Why should I?
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Jack.  Jack.
Would you remove your hat please?
Then what am I doing here?
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
What problem?
You're going to use Walter?
He won't be back in a hurry?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
I don't like him.
Rita. Pass the wine.
Where you been?
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
You're welcome.
Have I been a good wife?
Rose, pass the wine.
I don't know what you mean.
You haven't said anything.
Here.  Ti amo.
I'm getting married.
Yeah.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
It's temporary.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
You are going to marry my brother?
That's it.
This is good. Uhh...
What are you doing!
Stop it!
Son of a bitch!
Oh my God.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Alright.
Hi.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
No thanks.
I'm here!
Ronny!
It's Johnny Cammareri.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Will you marry me?
Yes, on the floor.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
I like this ring.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
Why not?
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Maybe I should go?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Sorry. That was rude.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Then why are you eating alone?
Go ahead.
May I walk with you a ways?
He's a plumber.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
I don't know.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
The same!
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What is that?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
I move for no man.
Stop that.
I'll do you for that.
Come Here.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
What?
Who are they?
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
What?
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Too late.
... You silly sod.
Oh, shut up.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Sorry ...
Yes, Lord.
Well?
The nose?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
To seek the Grail!
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Who's that then?
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
I don't want land.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
Leaving the room ... yes.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Until you, or anyone else ...
Yes ...  make sure ...
Camelot ...
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
They're all saying the word ...
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
I speak as I find, Archie.
How much?
And she sent no word down?
What are you doing?!
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
It's what the maids are for.
Hey, Barney.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Mother....
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Her Highness' Equerry.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
Awaiting my orders.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
Go inside at once.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
This is a slur on her good name.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
Surely --
They don't see it.
She'll think I betrayed her.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
We took a nip of whiskey.
What is it, John?  John?
John?
Ma'am?
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
I came as quickly as I could.
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
This is my good John Brown.
Should we take it seriously?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
Mrs Brown.
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
Erysipelas.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Where did you find it by the way?
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Has he been hurt?
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Read it.
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
What do they want?
Does that thing work?
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
But how can it change every time?
Dead?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Now what seems to be the problem?
What's her problem?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Hello?
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
Can you turn off the game?
It is.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Then where do we go?!
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
You're not coming, Alex.
The clock's already ticking.
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
So how do I start?
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
Adam, where are you?
But I'm not broke.
So what's the problem?
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
What did I say?
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
So, what did they say?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
It's unbelievable!
Wow!
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Betty Elms?
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
No ..........I.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
What is it Rita?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
No.... I don't...
Okay.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
"So... surprise"...
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
Yes, Sir.
You're so easy.
Yeah, what for?
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
No.  I haven't seen any.
You must come in first place to move on !
Is that it ?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
How do we get out of this room ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
I... I .....
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
This is cute.
Do you know where you're going ?
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
Hand me the 3/8ths.
When I think you're ready.
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Zachary.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
The power went out in half the park.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
What an incredible view !
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
Not now, Mom.
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
I'm talking to you asshole !
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
He was right behind me !
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
This is California, anything is possible.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
THANK YOU.
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
Do what?
Visualize a spare?
So you're saying...What are you saying??
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
No nuns, got it.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
What happened to Shelly?
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Hi.
This is really very nice of you.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
He's writing. Hello?
Thanks
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
Vada.
Get married?
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Uh oh...
It's dangerous!!
Hey look!
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Write me a poem?
Maybe.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
I think this place is just fine.
I'm just tired.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Good morning.
Well I'm sort of involved.
They're enormous, I know.
Did it hurt a lot?
Let me hold him.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
You're such a baby.
Of what??
Danny?
Keep your voice down!
You are perfectly healthy.
Can't you see it?
It's there.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
Uh huh?
You don't like it?
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
Harry, I really think she.....
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Home sweet home.
Dance with me?
What are you wearing?
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
I like the freak show.
Hi Vada.
Why not?
What was my mama like?
Oh yes, oh that's great.
What do you get for that?
Does he love her?
Do you like her?
Is that your camper?
He's allergic to everything.
He won't give it to me.
Are you married?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
NO!
Daddy??!?!?!
Where's Daddy?
I think it should be outlawed.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
At what?
Hurry!
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
It's a mosquito bite.
Where's your bike?
Do you remember her?
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
Why are you running away?
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Say something it's too quiet.
What?
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Stay, huh?
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
We'll never be the same.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Zit cream?
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
Excuse me?
Don't you have to be somewh...
How about...
And loving him means loving all of this.
And the answer was so simple.
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Exactly what?
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Uh, Kimmy...?
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
Ex-cuse me?
Is anybody watching?
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
Well, you're a little early...
And she's all wrong for me!
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Every day.  She makes the bed.
You never eat when you're despondent.
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Don't you throw up on boat?
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Takes me back.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
What happened?
Michael...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
This is her family and her fault.
Thank God you were here.
The Big Hurt, huh?
Uh.  I saw that moving...
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
Lower.
I never forgot that.
Almost three.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Winifred.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
You're from out of town?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
What did you say your name was?
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
What do you really want?
You bet.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
His Word.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
How is she?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Barbara Jean.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Where'd he ever see us?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Where are you going?
Come on. He's a crook.
You bet.
He's my father.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
Yes, sir. I need a room
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
Did you see who that was?
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Wrecks.
We don't mess with accessories.
What kind?
What year?
The car broke down.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Well, can you tell me why?
Do you like him?
Yes. Who's this?
Who is this?
I'm not sure. Where?
I'd really like to see you.
How old are you?
Thirty?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
You know who that is?
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
Where's Bill?
Probably a little too long.
I know a couple.
Ah... Peter Finch.
Got me an audition tonight.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
What kind of pies do you have?
Which do you recommend?
Naw, she don't mind.
By all means, knock yourself out.
Looked like an interview to me.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Who is we?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Do you have a back up.
Sorry about that.
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Tell me about the purity.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Says the United States of America.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
I admire them.
Only on a much grander scale.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
Roger, no.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
What's the travelling arrangements?
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Ya know, I was.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
Boy - you hear me?!
Want to talk to you.
You a union man?
What d'you want?
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Guess so.
That's two bucks, Joe.
They must work on the section gang.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
Let's go, Duff.
That's why you come back, huh?
But I would like to see you again.
What d'you mean?
I wouldn't have let you.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Surprised?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
That's right.
You know how to box?
My kids want me to teach them.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
How come you keep askin'?
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
No point fixin' it!
Don't do that!
Okay.
What's so hot 'round town?
A whole lot, Frankie.
That's right.
Good-bye, Frankie.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
What happened?
No.
Seems a little loose!
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
How often does he get like that?
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Omar--
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
What you lookin' for, mon?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
You ran without us.
Yeah, well it's working.
I saw your girl yesterday.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
How much time you got left?
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
You're late.
Wait... You hear that?
I know who you are.
What about before that?
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
How soon is soon enough?
I'm going in.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
On a good run... yeah.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
Case... Are you alright?
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
Is he going to make it?
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Who?
Like what?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
What?
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
What's that?
YOU DID.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Well excuse me.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Anita!
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Okay. That's bad.
Bridgework?
What is this?
Wings?
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
What if I say no?
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
I love the way she writes.
This seat taken?
Are you--scared?
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Yes.
Into our group.
Josie, you look Rufus.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
Where're we taking him?
Coming...
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Are you nuts or something?
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
I think it's sad...
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Are you okay.
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
What is it?
It's gone now.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Jess?
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
What?
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
That was different.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
What are these, beauty marks?
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
You got five minutes.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
Yes, tell us, Nancy.
This is nice.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
Then maybe you're ready.
The truth.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
Who would know where they were hidden?
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
I could've saved them.
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
What did you think?
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
C'mon.
We're here.
I'm in.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
And then I... right.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Thank you.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
If that's all right.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Whoopsidaisies.
No, I didn't.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
Hi.  Can I come in?
I have thought about you.
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
Eleven.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
Wow.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
Hi.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Yes.
No.  Not true...
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Bella -- this is Anna.
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
I was called and I came.  What's up?
What do you think?  Good move?
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Cappuccino as ordered.
That's right -- Topol.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Cool, huh?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Oh my God...  Hello.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
Was it you?
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
How was she?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
Get up, Billy.
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Sorry to have bothered you.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
I hope everything is settled.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
What's your name, buddy?
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
Yeah, kid?
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
H-H-Help!
What is it, kid?
In ya go...
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
What? What?
Martini!
What are you doing?
Did to me?
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
Twenty-five dollars.
I'm busting outta this place.
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
You can come back later!
Big king, too bad...
Bet a nickel!
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
I don't, Doc...
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
How do ya know that?
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
Yeah!
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Got a cigarette?
A dime.
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Who is he?
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Yeah!
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Is everything all right?
And you haven't heard the last of this!
Is he in an asylum?
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
Were they pen pals?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
You...
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Congratulations.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
That's not the point.
Why can't you just tell me?
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
Why are you asking me this?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Hi, Peter.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
Hey--
Nice dress.
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
Hi.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
What would you call it?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Very funny.
So, what are we waiting for?
I don't have an Amana freezer.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
Is everything okay?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
No.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
What's he do?
Is that bad?...
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
I have vacation time coming to me.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Live happily ever after.
I just got a dial tone--
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
You think he misses me at all?
What did you say to her?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Hi-iii...
It was a ouija board, remember?
Amazing...
Joan Collins stayed here.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
And he is living proof.
Maybe I can change him.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
I came after the woman I love.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
It'll do.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business?
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
I wish I knew.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
But my own kid bro
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
It was you, Charley... .
What makes him so special?
I think we're O.K.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
What's that?
What for?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Wham... .
It's quite  nice.
Terry!
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
What are you crying for?
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.
I don't rate it.
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
My hand.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Charley.
My pigeons... .
Every one of 'em... .
I don't get it!
It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
D 'n D?
So help me God!
Waterfront Crime Commission ?  What's that?
Never will be much too soon.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
You looking for me?
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
She's a he. His name is Swifty.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Do you?
Go on a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
Listen Nolan
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Something's making that music.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
I'm so frightened.
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
Well?
I would have time for my own pleasures!
Oh, if there is only time!
You may take her now.
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Yes.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
He called the day he escaped.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
You were his what, his box?
I'm not dressed.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
Where in the hell are we?
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
How long were you with the girl?
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
And she saw you?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
You find out?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
You ever wear one of these?
Hello, Daniel.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
All right, but...
That's all I wanted to know.
You get the key?
Put it down or I'll shoot.
You excited?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Who was the friend?
Hello?
Karen, I told you not to--
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
You comfy?
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
That's my dad.
Why not?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
Well, does it make sense to you?
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
You know I saw you on the street.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
So.  What's your point?
Weren't you expecting us?
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Thanks for your help.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
You goin' right back to work?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Foley?  That you?
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
You busted out?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
The <u>ninth</u>?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
And is Foley a part of this?
Gee, I wonder why not.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
Thing I'm worried about is you.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
You're a fighter?
What's wrong with you?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
He's about to.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
"Hey, yourself."
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
Was it Foley?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
You wave back?
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Midge.
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
What lizard?
Yeah.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Then why are you looking for her?
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
We gotta face some facts here.
You hear my okay?
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Yeah.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
Well sure, Colonel --
How'd you get this?
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
What else can we do?
Rafe --
It must of been a convincing letter.
What if the Japanese did invade?
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Leapin' Jesus!
I have'na been able ta --
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
Hello, Lilla!
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
Carol!
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
The only one?
They're waiting. Come on.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
All right. What's the scoop?
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
And we're here on the couch...
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
You drive like a maniac!
A lot's happened since last weekend.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
What do you know about classical music?
Charlie. About last nights..
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
What're you doing here?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Just take a look at it.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Ssh. He's great.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Yes.
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Jack, I was just trying to help.
I have a note.
Would you get that, dear?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
What's up?
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
What're you doing?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
What do you know about hypnosis?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
What's the matter?
I came to say goodbye.
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
I hear you moved into town.
That's Renee alright.
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Out?
What do they do up there?
What?
Just out.
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
Zowie...
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
You want me to help?
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
Jesus.
Allright. Calm down.
Thanks, Walter.
Thanks, you guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?
It could be parasites, an infection...
Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops.
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
What's wrong with you?
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
I'm ready...
Whatever.
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
Client of yours?
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
Congratulations.
Nine.
Big trouble.
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
Rayisha.
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
PARRTYY!
What?
I've considered that.
I know a good probate lawyer.
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
A regular all-American guy?
What do you love about it?
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Some do. I didn't.
In some situations.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Objection!
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Were you pleased with his work?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Going on... like...?
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
Let's continue.
Julius!
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
Tell me that was you.
Oh, Lord....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Power cells.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
Back to the ship, huh?
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
Step aboard, Carolyn.
Here. Make it easy on you.
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
He used that?
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
How much you weigh, Johns?
So you noticed too?
Just shut up, okay?
We cannot go through there....
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
Hasan?
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Where's Mr. Johns?
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
Suleiman!
A toast to whatever he just said.
Very big beads.
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
What's her name, anyway?
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
As you wish.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
Where does the river lead?
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
Do you have to work tonight?
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Look -- she remembers.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
How did it go?
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
Objection!
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
What happened?
Landon! Send a last signal.
Landon! Join the expedition.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
Lucius.
I told you not to bring the other one.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
ThatÕs a lie!
This is a joke in very poor taste.
No.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Are you going to take her with you?
Taylor! Tell him.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
It's humiliating.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here.
So what's the problem?
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
You lame Taylor?
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
First time?
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
No, thanks...
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
I didn't like it.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
You don't want to hear about it?
Right...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Indefinitely?
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
The brush-off, huh?
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
They might think I was running away from something.
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
Your liquor laws..
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
You tried to run away.
Certainly not to me.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
Well?
If you're doing all this just for me.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Mine?
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
Would I want to?
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
I think you mean that.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
You've had dealings with the police before?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
I expected nothing else.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
Time's up.  I'm off the case.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Name it.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
And without much discrimination.
All right, let's see the buzzer.
In case you want to have us followed.
Time for a little chat?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
What do I get for it?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
He checks too.
No.
Get out of here!
So-so.
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
Of course.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
Attributed?
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
I'll have some of that.
And some of that.  Sorry.
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
Good.
Oh yes?
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?
Did she talk about me?
In your car
Blasé and epicene.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
That's enough of that.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Still in love?
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
It was last year.
Don't point it at James!
What have you got there?
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
And that's why you never went pro?
What's their program?
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You're a fucking dead man--
I'm not armed.
Three seconds... two... one...
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
What?
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Good move.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
... so I started tailing him.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
What's goin' on?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Look at you.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Bye.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
Mean anything to you?
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Any sign of the hostages?
You're looking well, Dutch.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
What's he got?
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
You looking' for some company?
New York.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
What's your name?
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
You're joking.
No, but it's getting there.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Let's talk some more first.
It's a very good year.
Where'd you go?
All right.  How much for the week?
Three.
I'm not just talking about sex.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
This isn't a date.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
What's that?
What if someone tries to steal it?
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
I've never been on a plane before.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
I got tired of hating my father.
I didn't think so.
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Love this car!  Is it new?
I want to.
Edward, did you hear me?
What time's diner tonight?
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
'Lo.
Yeah.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Couple a hours.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
Oooh, I love those.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
What is it, Miss Vivian?
Hi, Barney!
Are you looking for something in particular?
Yes?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
You don't believe me?
He will come for me.
Brides often are, I'm told.
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
Rest, Highness.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
We'll never survive.
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
We did it.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
I only dog paddle.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
Inigo.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
What?
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
What? What?
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
-- anything you want --
What? What?
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Thank you for everything.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
We'll wait until you're ready.
How old were you?
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
You're just stalling now.
What's so funny?
Bye-bye, boys.
You feeling any better?
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
What did I do?
I'm not going to jump on you!
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Where would you like to eat?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
Maybe you're happy.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
What are you doing?
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
What is she gonna do here?
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Not.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
We make love?
Feeling better?
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
The Graf Spee...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
No.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
Cash.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Not at all!
I live there. Alone.
Of course not.
Why?
Casharoonie!
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
I still feel...
I'm Mary's sister.
Is something wrong?
What should I know?
Is Mary... in trouble?
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
I feel better when you feel better.
Arbogast said...
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think.
He didn't come back here?
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Our Deputy sleeps.
Yes.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
Sorry.
What is it?
We could laze around here a while longer.
For what?
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
I can come down next week.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
I've caused you some trouble.
You eat like a bird.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
I imagine so.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
Except you.
In quite a hurry.
You slept here all night?
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
...Forty thousand dollars!
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
Then you knew of the inheritance?
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
How do you do.
What's down there?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
Did you hear?
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
Did you? Where?
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
There's no hurry. It's early.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
We'll be coming to the opening.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
Let me go! Let me go!
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Are you giving me this straight?
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
What do you mean police dog?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
I told you he was a sore.
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before --
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
That's what I said.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
You weren't going with her?
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
Why?
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
To lunch.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
She is the soul of that statue.
Mia...?
Could you?
They're filthy, Mother.
I know, Mother.
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
You were up late last night, Brother.
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
There goes Mother.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
Why is it taking so long?
Are they polar bears, too?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
I am ahead of you.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
She hasn't actually done anything...
She does look a little peaky.
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Honey!
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
Strange voices, Rose?
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Galley what?
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Yes, Ma'am.
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Rose, you don't have to.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
And... ?
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
No offices are gonna be open today.
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
Wh... what... ?!
Where we going?
How you doing back there?
What's mine say?
That's him alright.
No, we're stealing.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
He went to pick up lunch.
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Pure horse.
Arriving tonight
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
Yeah... great.
Alright?
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
Can't be worse than you.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
What... ?  Not you too?
That's not true.
You need a doctor.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Get his attention.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
Why the beach?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
The gang's all here!
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
I told you to remain on the command ship.
I don't know.  Fly casual.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
I...
I'm sorry.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
All wings report in.
What's he saying?
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Then you know why I have to face him.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Janet!
Janet.
Yes Brad.
Uh huh.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
What was that bang?
Oh....Say something.
Right!
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
What a guy
What guy
Wheeling
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
I just dislocated my finger.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
...Guess.
Why?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
Would ya take off your glasses?
'Bout seven.
Like?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
...And he called the reporters --
What was that you said about a pet shop?
...I dunno.
I can't go out.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
Don't do that again!
He won't last one round.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
How was the flight, Champ?
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
Kiss my ass.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Nine minutes!
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
What's ya name again?
A hundred an' thirty.
What about for food an' stuff?
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
What?
...Screw you.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
How old?
The legs must be goin'.
...Did ya fight last night?
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Did ya get the message, kid?
What's happened is freak luck.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
...What?
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Whatta you get outta this?
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Yo, Paulie.
Yo, Paulie.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Why?
Help what?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
You ballin' her?
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
What was <u>that</u>?
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
So altruistic.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
How did you get onto Doom?
Hold on a second.
Now what?
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
'Tis he.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Juliet!
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
What?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
So thrive my soul--
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Why, may one ask?
And so did I.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
Meaning, to court'sy.
Pink for flower.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
This is important.
So what's the deal?
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
Do I need to repeat myself?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
Hazard pay...
I still am.
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Here's yours.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
We'll die if we stay here!
Then where is it?
Sent it where?
So what do we do?
He's tough, your American friend.
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
He sees this differently, as you well know.
Created?
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
Long enough to shoot back.
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
Where is this broad?
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
What's going on?
It was at that.
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
And what job is that?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
It is at that.
What the fuck happened?
That's a good question.
You son-of-a-bitch...
You speak French.
What happened to it?
It's the Irish tape we want.
Doing well.  This is?
What the hell happened here?
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
That's right!
I've got one condition.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
It's the right thing to do.
That's not what I mean.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
And how do you figure we do that?
You think he's bluffing?
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Do you have everything?
Dwayne's dead.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
I'm all ears.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
How are ya?
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
You're worth every last penny.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
A satellite dish?
I don't know, Booth.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Why does that bother you?
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
What?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
C?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
Just goes to show you.
She's not his type.
Jesse?
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
What's this?
Don't you want to hear about my day?
I'll settle for a third of that.
We're out of here.
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Hi ma.
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
That's great Earl!
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Winner six!
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
So tell me what you know.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Yeah, that's right.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
I have plenty of dates.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
How do you know he's our man?
No.  It was my singing.
Is it hot in here?
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
She saved our lives.
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
See you in the next world.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Vegas...
Red Dragon.
Ricky Tan is alive.
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
That your gate down there?
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
Are you okay?
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Shut up!
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
He was just doing his job.
Where were we?
Shortcut?
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
What?
You talk too fast.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
You like it?
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Are you OK?
Want some?
Excuse me?
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
I'm sorry, Lee.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Jesus...what do you want?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
How about a lift home?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Where do we find him?
Yes.
I would like one of my people to help.
You look awful.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
"Nothing but net."
-- It's for you, Ike.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
I think you'd look good in red.
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
I'm a work in progress.
I don't know.
I'll have the same.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
It's fun!  It's high.
I already explained about that.
What!?
I love you.  I love you.
And the church.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
Used?
I'm listening.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
What are you talking about?
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
What?
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
Am I what they had in mind?
Is that all right with you?
Happy New Year, darling.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
Beautiful view, isn't it?
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" --
Can too.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
Did you talk to him?
I love you, too.
But he saw you, right?
You're going to miss the train.
What are your plans in New York?
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Go home for the weekend.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Howard.
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
It's probably just the flowers --
Are his folks nice?
Magic.  It was magic.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Sure you do.
Hello.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
Why not?
Where's your mom?
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
You'll see.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Eighty dollars.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
Dad?  About last night?
Not.
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
This one's for both of us.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Dad!
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Why is she bringing that bag?
Thank Victoria for dinner.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
What's wrong with Annie?
No.
What if I couldn't get to you?
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Oh.
Is he there?
Got any more ideas?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Why are they singing, Mama?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
Four nights. How did you sleep?
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
Go on. Spill it.
Forgot what?
Luís! Come down here!
Where's your mama?
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
Bobby?
What?
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Yeah.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Go ahead.
I can't leave.
Fuck you.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
: What are you up to?
I need my paycheck.
He knows where I work.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
Where to?
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Was he the president?
Okay
What the hell is that?
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
What the hell is this?
I've got a hot one.
No last name?
Danny, I'm touched.
Thanks for not judging me.
You don't find that repugnant?
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
I was getting to it.
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Danny?
We know what's going on.
Jimmy?
When is the deal going down?
Nervous?
You mean like the Donner Party?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Find a chaplain.
Resistance?
But, sir...I...I...
Good luck, John.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
Yep.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
Jackson?
Last I knew.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
Yes, sir.
No kiddin'?
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
Upham?
It seemed appropriate.
Over three-hundred.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Fresh out.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
Oh, yeah?
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
What do you think?
Uh, oh.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Trust me, you're the best.
I'm listening, sir.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
Yes, sir.
Don't do that again.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Shit, sir.
Frogs?
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
How fast?
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
You're tough, J-man.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Yes.
What does it say?
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
I can put that together.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Tell me, is it bad news?
I won?
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Morning honey.
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
You should be.
Lloyd?
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
I swear to god.
You think you know what this money is?
I made their lives better.
That's right, work it out.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
You will?
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Are you busy on Friday?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Have a good sleep.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Stop by later.
You have to meet Bess.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
Why didn't you tell me?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
You shared it with a dick.
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
What do you want?
You do?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
What?
One more time would be nice.
I'm fine.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
The guy with the Datsun?
Okay, I'll give here the message.
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Thanks Lloyd.
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
I love you man.
Later for you, Luke.
Well, let's find him.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
What -
Luck.
Should I stay?
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
You took my workers.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
What do I got for you?
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
How many?
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
Good.  How's it going?
What are you doing?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
It kind of looks that way.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
I was just the accountant.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Pots and pans.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
Eight hundred, give or take.
That's very generous of you.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
How's the name search going?
Can't we hold him?
Shit.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I did that.
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
And are the police sure about that?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
What are you going to do?
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
No way.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
She's got guards with her.
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
And now, drum roll please...
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
You broke my heart.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Let's go.
Sid, I'll come with you.
Time to change numbers again?
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
And white.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
..this week's TKE kegger...
..it's really about family and tradition...
I hate scary movies.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
What do you want?
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Who?
Please, call me Gale.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
Jesus Gale what happened?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Did you request this case?
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Stop following me.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Thank you.
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Just because you knew her?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
What'd he say?
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
Where?
Yeah?
What? She asked.
How'd you do?
Duh... that's quick.
Nope.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
I thought she was dead.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
You know what my dad will do to you?
You know that's not true.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Why did you kill my mother?
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
So why did you dial it again?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
What?
I don't know.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
That's not what you said.
I have to go now.
Yes?
What do you want?
Dial someone else, okay?
I wanna play a game.
I don't know...
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
And why is that? Has something happened?
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
You girls ready.
I was first to respond.
Drive by patrol.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
That fish smelled strong.
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
I want to talk to you.
You owe my mother.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Where do you get this shit?
I have no idea.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Stu was with me last night.
Don't come any closer.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
So what's his reason?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
What's Leatherface doing here?
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Or a man's mentality.
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
You've left unfinished business before.
Have you heard?
Already.
It's none of my business anymore.
Give me the gun.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
Drop it.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
It could be nothing.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
It's my wife.
Well?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Did you read them?
This is the one thing.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
What?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
And?
How did the fire fight end?
Sorry about that... I just...
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
So they ran our list.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
Think about it...
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
Oh, you want to stay now?
Anything... anything missing or different.
Are you absolutely certain?
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
Did their son see it happen?
How's California?
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
He cometh forth like a...
You got any more orders, Captain?
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
Ay-eh...They was here...
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Told ya, didn't I?
That's what I said.
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
Well, come on!
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
You all right, Ethan?
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
Say it. We're beat!
Good night...Laurie...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
I think maybe we oughta...
Well, you're a widower now...
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
She'd be about thirteen now...
Where?
Ellen, move aside...
Stop that!
I mean the armchair!
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
I'll do it myself.
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
So, did you sleep good?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
Where have you been?
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
What?
She was old.
Martin, what-
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
I really hate to bother him, but...
Hello.  Can I help you?
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
Mrs. Straub!
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Hammer?
What do you want, Kit?
Tomorrow.
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
We will all be put in the clink.
Words, words, wordsonce, I had the giftI could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnerybut now
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
So what do we do?
How?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
God be praised!  Locked?
Now where? Will?
Will! Have you finished?
By God, I wish I knew.
We are lost.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
Kit
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
Ethel.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
Be good to her, my lord!
Like Valentine and Silvia?
Your Majesty.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
Your Majesty
Your Majesty!
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Even your play.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Oh, do not go
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
Take off your hat.
And break her heart and mine?
Is there a man?
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You're a bad loser.
What do you think?
I'm only asking what you think.
I won't be able to.
What's the problem?
How much did you pay?
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
Who?
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Don't know what?
Is this being recorded?
Sorry to waste your time.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
So we'll meet him, then?
-- instead of what he is --
I think you're lying.
Maybe he didn't like us.
What sort of car?
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Unfeasible.
Who's going to do it?
Sshh.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
What's he doing here?
Will you calm down.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
You know we're right.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
We have to talk.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
I refuse.
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
Don't you ever stop?
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Why do you want a room here?
Just get on with it, Alex.
Is this what they always look like?
I've never seen a dead body before.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
That's what it cost, David.
Expecting anyone?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
I thought you'd gone to work.
We already know. All about it.
What do we do here, David?
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
You get the job done.
You must be Hugo.
What's it about?
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Working nights?
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
Same as everyone else.
Diseases.
I suppose so.
Your watch.
Don't you like her?
What're you talking about, George?
Do you think George is a fairy?
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
What?
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know.
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
Nummers.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Your husband?
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Are you in love with her?
Are you?
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
Chopped liver?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
No kidding.
No shit.
That you're just like your mother.
Right now?
Wonderful woman.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
And you need money?
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
You're late, George.
What!
I'm sure.
Where do you want to do this?
Well, what do you think?
You don't seem very sure.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Why not?
And?
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
George... how about Felicia?
Did you?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
-- what guy?
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
Don't do it.
-- gee...
He still having parties?
-- sure.
-- what?
-- very nice, very nice.
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
Yeah!
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
Jackie Shawn.
Now, George --
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
You're different.
You've never even been around one.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Hey, I'm, you know --
George.
When is that, George?
What?
A friend dropped me off.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Now, Jackie --
That was him.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
What do you wanna know for?
-- please, baby --
... well I'm glad you told me.
-- yes.
George...
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
It's an unusual trade.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
... she's very upset...
I know it, I know it.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
Me!
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.

A daytime soap opera.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
Here.
No.
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
That's right.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
What?
C'mon.
-- Yesss?
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Egypt?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Why don't you ask for another one?
Johnny!
George? Was he alone?
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- there's not much room --
You seem disappointed.
No!
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
I'm hungry.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Are you having a good time?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Chocolate.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Red Rum.
Mommy... Mommy...!
Shall we go into the living room?
Please...
Grady?
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
No charge?
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
Did you find anything?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
And you didn't see anything at all?
You mean just leave the hotel?
Jack!
I...
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me,
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me.
Wendy...
I'm Jack Torrance.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
Well, obviously some people can be
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Yes. Go away.
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Please, Uncle Al.
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Rattling. Rustling.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Mom-!
You all right, Marty?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
Yeah? Really?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
Oh my!
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Like this place?
Shirelles.
What?
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Babies
Is there any syrup?
JUST SING!
Come on, we're late.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
We need experience.
Who are all these people?
Goddamn it!
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
I see.
It has come to pass.
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
No!  No!  I can't do this!
The vow of obedience.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
So... hi there.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
I just need a few more weeks,
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
You're not... seeing anybody?
Vince knows you're here.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Then one day they find you.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
We're looking for Mike.
A nun?
There she is!
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
What's she doing?
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
They spend two days in chains.
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
Your superiors are two days away!
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
May we look at them now?
Maybe you should take this.
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
I manage fine alone.
What is the common thread between these victims?
It's spectacular.
Thank you.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
What is it?
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
What now?  Where is she?
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Why would you do such a thing?
And this gives worth to butchery?
It is only me.
I apologize if I worried you.
Blood.
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
Can you help?
What... what are you doing?
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
I don't reckon.
Yeah, they's good all right.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Well, what did you want?
Did you decide, sir?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Yeah.
About a half a mile I think it is.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Yeah.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Leave.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
I ain't sure.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
What's all them books?
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
But maybe just for awhile --
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
How come?
Do you like to play football?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Did you want to play ball with us?
How do you know?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
I like the way you talk.
Where'd you get them flowers?
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
You want to go with me?
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Oh, jackin' off?
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
So it died when it come out?
A boy or girl?
It was still alive when you buried it?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
It was fun, anyhow.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Yes sir.
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
I know he does.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
I'm ye boy.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Thank ye.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Well, okay. I got you some.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
We sure like havin' you.
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
That boy wants me to.
I done et just a little bit ago.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Is he leaving right this minute?
I didn't mean that.
Where will he go?
What!
No! At least I don't think I am!
And your father? Is he from New York?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
I didn't know you took pictures.
A photographer ...
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
It's kind of overwhelming.
Slow down, huh?
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
Hey, man, how's it going?
Two, right?
You usually get two.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
I'm all ears.
Did you ever go back to see her?
She probably died.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
What do you mean?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Seventeen.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
It'll never be finished.
Does it hurt?
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Thomas.
Well?
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Well, if you put it that way...
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Mostly what.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Of course. Where else?
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means.
And?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Celebrate? What for?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
Did you write that column?
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
Did you say more?
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
Cigarette?
You always run with the well open?
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
What makes you think I play?
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
You wouldn't even see it move.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
I believe so.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
What else could it be?
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
Is it possible?
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Are these your bags?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
You're welcome.
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
But suppose it doesn't?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
With me?
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
DAPHNE?
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Good night, Daphne.
What happened?
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
What happened?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Joe -
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
Sugar?
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
We'll take a rain check.
Oh - Sugar!
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
Anything wrong?
And your head is hot.
You all right?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
Not you, Sugar.
We don't have to run.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
No!
Brand new.
Yes, I'm holding on.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
About that roadhouse -
Another bridesmaid?
It doesn't matter.
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
I don't like no witnesses.
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
And you'll be in all evening?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
We got time off for good behavior.
We understand.
Put it here.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
Rough?
Really?
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Happy days.
What's happened?
Want to switch berths with me?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Three?
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
Where's your shell collection?
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Harmless - how?
See?  Nothing.
I don't want to bore you.
Is that anything?
Would you do me a favor?
Well - ?
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Good night.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
You're not?
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Daphne -
You'll forget him, Sugar.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
What'll it be, sir?
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Thanks, Charlie.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
If Ed ever found out....
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.
I thought you said you were crap.
I look like a total wanker, dont I?
You heading to the train station?
Whats his problem?
And Kat was fully clothed.
Seeing you again....
Youre not even listening.
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Im sorry?
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.
Is this for last night?
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
You have had girlfriends?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
You didnt have to do that.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
I am now, sir.
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
And you say all them people is dead now?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
What about Sounder?
Well, how did you like the class, David?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
And so you did your job, right?
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
Go on...
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
Well, looka here...
We didn't find Sounder yet.
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
Goodnight, Daddy...
Where's everybody?
From Miss Johnson --
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Who's winning, Mama?
Who is they?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
Any sign of Sounder?
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
What's wrong, Nathan?
It's about the Three Musketeers.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Is he gon' be gone long?
Whatcha wanta order?
Night, son!
Well, let's get to work!
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
What...
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
What is this?
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Is it Cartman's mom?
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
What?
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
Suck my balls.
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
Mph rmph rm!!
Goodnight, honey.
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
You've got a stupid accent too.
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
The N word?
Oh yeah.
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
Kyle?!
Hello there, children!!
Who are you, kid?
Ber dada!
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
SHIT!
Oh my God...
It's so very cold...
It's okay, I am done for.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Nowhere.
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
Oh, brother.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Oh dear God...
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
What about air strikes?
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
And Bill?
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Hello, Conan!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
What did you do today Satan?
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
Hey, I'm missing the party!
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Ow, you're hurting me!
Did you see that, Wendy?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wendy?
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Oh yeah...
Anna...
Evening.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
On channel 10?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
All too well, captain.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
You're certain of that?
So, are you on for the next one?
I think I can handle it.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
Barnes?
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Is that clear?
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
It's getting hard to breathe...
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
We don't.
OK...it's open.
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
I can't let you do that.
What's that?
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
And what are you going to do?!
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
What is happening around here!!!
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
You have orange whips?
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Three whips. To go.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
Think he bought it?
What's on your mind, Miles?
This scam we got going here was your
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
Need some advice, huh.
Where'd you get this ball?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
No...
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Where's Junior?
Fantastic! What talent.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
What's your specialty?
Uh...over easy.
What does he do?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
Come on, bargain with me.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
I can't tell you, Theo.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
Where are you going?
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
Fletcher!  Now!
How big is this spacecraft?
In basic English, what does all this mean?
Hold on --
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
But you've tested it?
Don't do it!
Norman, please!  Don't!
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
Then why am I here?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
But sir --
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
You don't think weapons are important?
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Nothing, sir.
Yes, sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
It's chipped.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
She wired this system.
Look at this.
We had considered it.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
Did you hear me, sir, because --
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
From the sphere?
What is that?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
What do you mean -- not normal?
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
Beth --
Don't do this.
You, me and Harry?
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Four days?
What's the matter?
You get it straightened out?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
You don't believe me.
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Looks like some sort of code.
It's for motion sickness.
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
Doesn't say.
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
You ever given an injection before.
The sphere looks different.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
He can't manifest.
You're lying --
You manifested that, Beth.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
Beth?
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Norman?  Where's Norman?
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
What?
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
Don't be defensive.
Nice work, Norman.
Our answer.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
You don't remember that?
Beth left?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
We're never gonna make it.
I can't reach her.
Push her, c'mon.
You know how to work this thing?
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
How's that working out, by the way?
She told me what you said, Norman.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
What'd you say?
Good idea, Ted.
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
You've heard of me?
What report?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Squint harder.
Well, he's polite.
What was it?
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
Was it a military crash?
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
The Empire must have gotten here first.
How much do you think she's talking about?
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
I found it... It's just not there.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
This isn't going to work.
I think she's going to be all right.
Is he afraid of the water?
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
No need, everything's under control.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Did you read her mind ?
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Profile's wrong... there.
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Where are you going ?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Zander, what are you doing ?
Good for you.
Eeuch !
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
I'm gonna miss you.
Shhhh...!
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
What's wrong with you ?
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
It stinks, you goin.
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
Mr. Rasczak.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Well, yeah, sure...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
How bad are you, pal ?
Mister Rasczak ?
All dead except one, sir.
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
<U>Why</U>...?!
<U>Why</U>?!
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
Our data is being prepared.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Yes.
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
What should you have known?
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
You bringing your new friend?
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
I want to rent this one.
The people in New Hampshire.
You haven't heard of it.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
You like my play.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
Goodbye.
...such a pleasant sound.
...who...?
How can you <u>say</u> that?
I...
No, I don't...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
What happened?
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
It's for your finger.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
What've you got?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
...yes.
...yes.
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
No, that's true.
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Press still works.
That's something a man could do...?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
But it'll stop the movie.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
What are you going to do?
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Big day last night.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
What courthouse?
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
Waterford, Vermont.
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
Fourteen year old girls.
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
The prices are going up.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
Aren't you ever in school?
Izzat so?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
No.
You have no right to...
Will you help me out...?
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
I know...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Did she throw up?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Why?
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
Doug, the traffic light...
...he's the producer of the movie.
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
My wife's going to have a baby.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
I had a witness I would.
Who's White...?
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
Town's out of lilacs.
Not now.
I...?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
What's the...
Why?
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
I've got a date.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
No, what is it?
Hi!
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
What is that...?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
Pay her off.
Yeah?
Do something.
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
We have to lose the window.
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
Why?
I'd rather be with Mommy.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Look she's upset --
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
I said...
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
You don't like his friends.
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
I don't want to say goodbye.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
That doesn't bother me.
No.  I think it's ugly.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
...your hating me.
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
You touched it.
Excuse me --
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
So you're okay.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
You say that like I don't know that.
And when did that pass?
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
Something's up wi...
Called him.  We set an ap...
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
Yeh?
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
However many.  It's not enough.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
I'm sorry, I just...
Jackie?
You feeling all right?
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
I really look like shit.
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
And I'm going to win.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Look.  I know they hate me.
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
No problem.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
Why in the world would she t...
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
I told her I loved her.
Restless.
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
Where you goin'?
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Hey.
You know...Stanley...
No prob. I'm cool.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Nice to have you here.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Really? How many?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Speak English.
Who is Jesus?
You have a bay?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Why was he on Death Row?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
The camerawork's nice.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
Don't even joke about that!
We used pull.
We did the same thing last year also.
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Ready for tomorrow?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Get the hell outta here!
OK.
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Come here, give me a hug!
It's over there.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Ni...
...gger.
No, not really.
OK.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Great. How old are they?
How'd you get it?
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
Can I see what you have so far?
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
What are we going to do!
What now?
What do you mean?
Now what?
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
Are the labs in operation?
That's it!  Up ahead!
Enjoying the tour so far?
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
So, what are we looking at White?
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Possibly some coffee?
Where are you trying to reach him?
What's the meaning of this?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Where is this...thing?
Yes?
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left.
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect...
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Does the threat board show anything?
General Schmuck?
You aren't sure!
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
I suppose they are, sir.
How much soda, sir.
What shall we drink to, sir?
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I don't think so, sir.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
And you'd like to see that?
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
Look, he's there, and you're here.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
Then this is it.
War.
Check.
Just the missiles.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
They can't touch us at this height.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
Shoot, Lothar.
What's your point, Lothar?
Primary circuit is live.
Second safety.
Yes, Major.
Can't "Ace" help you?
What happened?
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
Are you sure?
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
Forget it.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Um-hm.
Can I have some?
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
That was really great.
Typical male.
Uh, home, you know.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
Yup.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Your a nurse?
Any gunshot victims?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
Stuck with what guy?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
No, he's not with a girl.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
Tim...
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Ah, you know people there?
Yeah.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Buff.
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
Score! Yeah!
It's safe, come on.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Yeah, we're all above that.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
You make videos?
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Will you stand up for me?
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
Yes.
Deep down. Way down.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Two-fifty.
Can you tell me what happened?
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Tim, what are you talking about?
See ya later.
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
What? What'd you do?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Yes.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
I don't know.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
Nazeer what?
Your completely missing the point.
Yes, I stand for -
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Can I talk?
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Okay, what would you have done.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Mm-hm.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
No, it's not...
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Sorry.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Great.
For a while.
So who are you?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Look, get down off my property.
I hope you're happy!
Pony, oh my god!
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Oh!
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Yeah?
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Me?
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Is that Jeff?
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Tim?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
What are you going to do? Hm?
Yeah?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
So where are you?
Seriously? It's a great idea.
I'm going out later.
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Di, we're sorry.  We...
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
Let me explain something...
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Madonna.
Shut up.
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Oh no...
Don't use big bills!
Yeah?
Yeah?
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
Hannah, we've...
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
All of you!
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Give me your coat.
Good party.
Sure, this'll go on all night.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Hurt feelings department.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
I had a teacher like that once.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
What has Artie to do with it.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
It's just impossible.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
Good.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
Just a minute, you!
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
I will not have it butchered.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
They've come for my car.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Keep it.
What's the matter with you?
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
He must be quite a guy.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
Wanted what?
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
That's what I told them.
Whose room was this?
What doctor?
Uh-huh?
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
Joseph C. Gillis?
Got a title?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
What is the scene? Where am I?
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
Home?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
What's happening?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
This is my favourite place in the city.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
She said it wouldn't last.
That makes it worse.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
Hey! Ethan!
What is it?
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Hey, where you going?
Someone's chasing him.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
There isn't any.
I'd rather not talk about it.
Lucy; come back!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
What can I do for you?
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You're wasting your breath.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
That was meant for me!
Who are you ?
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
That horrible woman!
Zaltar, please help me.
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
Goodbye...
Brad?
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Do you really know Superman?
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
What kind?
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Turn on the T.V.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Can you do that?
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
You want to mess with Superman?
How you doing down there?
No, we're just going down.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
I know, by computers.
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
Ricky?  Where...what...
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
I can't see anything.
Where's the light switch?
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
It could make weather!
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
I don't?
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
It's true. It's true.
I was right. you are Superman.
I'm listening.
Let's go to my place.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Hi.
. . . Superman?. . . . .
I'll try to remember that . . .
You'll have to pack quickly.
Genius!  --  Lex.
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
He has powers as we do . . .
You must be freezing.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Put down Lex Luthor !
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
Free!
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
They make my eyes itch.
I've never been in a place like this before.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
Superman? Has something happened to him?
Impossible? Why?
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
Where's Clark?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
What was that about?
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
You think he'll find us.
What I need this for?
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
I'm not going anywhere.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Keep warm now.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
I'm telling you, I was there.
It wasn't a trick!
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
So I've noticed.
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
What do you suggest, my dear?
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
They stop for nothing.
No news is not good news. Y'know
Then -
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
It's a ...baby.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Lois, the kickback story...
Superman???
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
It must feel great.
How old are you?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Do you like pink?
Where do you hail from?
I...uh...
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
Please...
Is that real enough for you?
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
What is this??!
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
Which one?
She's in trouble?
I understand.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
Are you sure?
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
So what brings you out tonight?
Have you been waiting long?
What are you thinking?
Your kids never cry.
Good night, Billy.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
About the Ottos?
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
From what?
You heard what Abbott said?
Anything you didn't understand?
That's what he said, is it?
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
What do you think?
It's for the school bazaar.
How was it?
Is this mine?
Nicole!
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
Nicole?
That's right.
Yes.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
It was snowing.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Crafts.
Need a hand?
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
DADDY!!!
Yes.
News?
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
We do.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
No.
Yes.
You are?
I was scared.
Why not?
What do you remember about the accident?
What's so funny?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
How do you like it, Nicole?
Pretty slick, eh?
Do you like the colour?
Will the police do anything to her?
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
But of course...
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
I don't think so.
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Yeah!
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
But...
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
J.J., if you think -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
You haven't told him yet...
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
Do you know about the chip?
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
Where we going?
Can I stop by my house?
You sure?
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
You will.
Why do you cry?
We don't have much time.
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
They took him from me.
I know!
Kyle, don't go!
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
You look like handmade shit.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
On Furtwängler.
Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
What the hell are they doing?
What's that mean?
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
You live here, in Berlin?
You do shorthand and typing?
Steve.
I can't do this. It's not right.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Did you call someone you knew?
Why were they going to arrest you?
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
Steve Arnold...
What did Goering say?
What telegram?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Then you are wrong.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
Show me.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
One of your people told me.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
And ask him about his private life.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
What do you think?
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
And you're from the future too?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
We gotta get you to a doctor.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
You volunteered?
Good field-dressing.
He'll find us, won't he?
Don't say that.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Why were the other two women killed?
I can help you...
Here's her driver's license.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Call her.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
Did you play recently?
You don't talk to me like that.
I'm so sorry.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
This can't be real...
This is nuts.
You've got to be kidding.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
See you around.
Home.
I'll give you a boost.
This is C.R.S.
That one did.
Never did catch your name.
Where are we going?
Okay.
Then, what good are you?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Who is it?
Get us out of here...
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
Where'd you get that... ?
It's mine...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
I didn't know what else to call you.
I have to get to the airport...
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Originally, Connecticut.
One brother, one sister.
Julliard, yeah.
Hey there, Nickie.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
You look good.
Really?
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
But, will you?
How do you mean, exactly?
What have they been doing to you?
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
The phone's dead.
How did those... ?
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
Get rid of them.
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
You don't need me...
I've been so lonely.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
I don't like her.
What gentleman, Maria?
Nicholas...
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
I only saw Theo drive up.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
That could have been worse.
You're not telling us something.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
I didn't do it.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
It's still an electric shock!
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Are you working with her?
All the carvings.
Sorry.
All right...
And then what happened?
It was a stupid thing to do.
I don't know.
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
No.
Come on.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
Have either of you seen David Watts?
Oh God, we can't get out!
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
What did it cost?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
What do you do?
That's so sad.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
What'd you come back for, babe?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
I'm not.
Anything but Japanese.
Italian?
How they goin', kid?
You broke last time.
Fuck you.
Huh?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
What more is there.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
You're kiddin' me, right?
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Huh?
That was one of them?
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
Steady on.
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
Do you have any friends, man?
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Perhaps it was the smoke.
How d'you mean?
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
What line is he in.
I see.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Only in the movies.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
Where's Big Sur?
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
Where is he now?
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Been away a lot.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
There is?
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
I don't get it.
He's expecting you?
Is Valentine here?
Hello there.
What kind of trouble are you in?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
What.
Hello, Rachel.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
...Mm.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
No problem!
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
...That's quite a wife you got there.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
Your place?
...What kind of man *are* you?
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
Dave.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
Coffee, Ed?
Yeah.
That was quite something.
Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
...Ed?
Jesus...
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Frank.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
'Lo, Ed.
Doesn't bother me.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
He's a barber.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
I'll go down and speak to him.
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
What happened to them?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
I think I should come with you.
I smell it.  It's here.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
It's still back there!
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
What does it say?
What's that doing here?
What are we talking about here?
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
You work here?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
This room sucks.
Quiet!
Not that big.
They've got something.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
Jesus, what is this?
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
How does it work?
How did you know that?
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
You're not.  Where is it?
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
That was D'Agosta.
Is there another way around?
What is it doing?
What happened?
Help someone!
I don't believe it.
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
It's the busy season.
Close up?
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
Cue music...
Welcome.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
That's correct.
The creator of what?
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
Nothing was real.
You take Japanese.
Lauren, right?
No.
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
What're we doing here, Truman?
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Stay where you are!
What's the hurry?
Arrah!
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
--Darling--
It looks so small.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
How's it going, Truman?
Do you live around here?
I think you better tell us.
I need your clothes, Byers.
What is it you find incredible?
No, they don't.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
And if it's unsuccessful?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
I'm looking for him.
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
How'd you find me?
And what's that?
Those people were already dead.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
You know my work?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
-- You saw this experiment?
What do you think?
Jesus, Mulder...
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
Had you.
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
...thirteen fifty six...
Scully?
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They were the ones that put us together.
You're... quitting?
Are you drunk, Mulder?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
What are my choices?
You think they went left?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Yeah, well they may this one.
This is weird, Mulder.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
You hear that?
What? What's wrong?
We've got to keep moving.
On whose orders?
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
You're lying.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Why are you telling me this?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I'd be there for him.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
There's always a chance they'll confess.
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
Why'd you bring him here?
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
Where the hell are we?
That went well.
What now?
Agent Cole.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
Into Stargher.  Inside...
Is she alright?
How's the patient.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
Ich weiss nicht.
Den leuten.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
Anything really wrong with your papers?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Do I...
When...what did you do?
...and buried him.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
...Headquarters.
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
That's his headache.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
They are - private - letters.
Where?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
It wouldn't work.
A girl of spirit.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Win what?
What time is it?
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Welcome?
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
What's that?
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
...the best way one can, you know.
Are you mad?
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Thank you.
Coffin?
Baron Kurtz.
Excuse me!
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
I was told that he did not die at once.
That's all you meant?
What else did he tell you?
Mr. Martins...
...Mr. Martins?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Excuse me.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
I don't know - I'm American.
Richard - I saw a fin!
Did you sleep well?
I think so too.
Exactly.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
No one follows that midrash.
What's a fascist?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Which is what?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
Is he a Nazi?
Your father??
How come there's no punctuation?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
I didn't realize you cared.
That's a much easier game.
Who's Eichmann?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
Why are you taking that?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
You wouldn't announce it?
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
It was a nine millimeter.
Think about your father. Your sister.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
Don't tell me what I --
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
What part of Germany are you people from?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
Do you feel you're making progress here?
How have things been going?
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
Hello...?
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
Which one were you aiming at?
That's all we've got left.
Oh, what is this shit?
Not too fast.
Mrs. Moebius.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
Are you an artist?
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
And what did you do?
Leary?
Adam Sandler.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
What do you mean?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
It can't be true!
Good afternoon.
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
He seems to have won it.
This is a great pleasure.
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
He can learn.  He is learning.
How do you know that?
Ten thousand.
Dollars.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
No.
Your mother?
Why?
Good night.
Can I come in?
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
I'm concentrating.
... Push me back in the water...
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
Hello?
What?
Jacques...?
Promise me one thing.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Why don't you ask me?
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
How was your trip?
... And those?
Who... Who is that?
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Will he understand Spanish?
Wait!  Professor...?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
We do!
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Mom! We're eating!
But we're not open on Sundays.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Mmmyes.
This is for "mama and the kids."
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
They don't say it to me.
Sure.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
What's left of him.
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things.
What, senorita?
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Show business?
Well, I'd best be off.
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Some crazy guy.
To the eye? Like other men.
Tormented -- ? Why?
What do you do now?
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
That was unfortunate.
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
That's a fact, isn't it?
You're too good to me.
No - not yet.
No  not yet.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
We stood here once before.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brothers death.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnt here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Dont. You might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until youve done what we are paying you for.
I found this at your brothers.
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
I still dont buy your story but I figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Are we understood?
Mr Lombard...
Black suits you.
How... When did you...
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman Id stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didnt you?
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Dont you believe in simplicity?
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brothers not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
I cant believe this...  Whats coming now, eh? If I dont pay all Hells gonna break loose, is that it?
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry.
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Hi...
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people!  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!
Why?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
Whos the money man?
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
And who does Friedman work for?
Whats the Ambassador?
Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Any friends?
Im sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
What happens now?
Vous êtes Français?
Lets go.
Am I supposed to know him?
Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea?
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe I dont.
Trying to say something, Martin?
Its about the puppy. You got the money?
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
Im sorry...
He just said he had good reasons.
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse...  And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions...
Is she on the phone?
I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Fine...
What about which girlfriend?
Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
Three...
Why did you kill him?
Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
When they realise Im missing...
What do you mean?
It's a miracle she's not dead!
I would like some fresh straw.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
I also need someone who can read and write.
I thought you were an archer?
Good.
What did the king say?
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
We have to press home the attack!
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
And?
Why?
Yes, but...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
How old are you?
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
Your majesty, I really think you...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
Good.  Where are the English?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Do you know how to count?
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
I don't know... I thought...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I... I never lied!
Why were you yelling like that?!
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
Why would they?
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
"Love your enemies"...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
Then... why are you here so often?
Beautiful.
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
A beauty. Who is she?
Really?
How are you doing?
How long have you been married?
What did I tell you?
Let me see this.
For what? For my tie?
Have you seen this?
What's happened?
Funny time to say this.
Can you help?
We're recruiting.
And suppose they take the table away?
What's this about?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
What's the matter? Are you sick?
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
But I want to help, I want to.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
What's your work?
What's happening?
Are the Russians here?
What about you?
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea!
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
I worry for you.
Yes, why not.
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
She wants to see what you can do.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
What's in here then, lead?
We can't leave the piano
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
Mama.
You the owner here?
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
Twist, you know this guy?
You're late.  Where you been?
How much did ya lose?
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
Then why ain't he dead?
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
I like griftin'.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Mottola.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
You think he'll show?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
You wanta wait for your share?
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
How ya doin'?
See and raise five.
Who are you?
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
My end was only one.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
You done?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
You're dreamin', kid.
Get on with it then.
You really picked a winner, kid.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
What happened to your face?
You want a drink or something?
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
What about this Rosebreen?
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
What is it? Has he found him?
What is it?
You took that money from Julia's hand.
Is your father still in there?
You know, we know each other.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
She fell down.
I don't know.
Dead?
It's been the same one for three months.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
Yes.
How'd you people happen to pop in?
What about the suicide?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
Well, what'd you think?
Who're you calling?
Get anything?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Could this be him?
Are you kidding?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
You mean that body-----?
Shut up.
About three.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
You did!
But he's interested!
Have a shot?
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
Chris!
Who's that man?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
That's my business.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Did you get my money?
I'm not telling anyone.
Thanks, and goodbye.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
How are you?
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Perfectly absurd.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
What's that?
What am I?  The fall guy?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
What are you going to do with it?
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
Who gave it to you?
Finished with these?
Aren't you hot in that?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Sit down!
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
What are you going to do?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
I've got a lulu -- why?
The suspects!  They won't come.
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Is that true?
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
You worked here?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
You his wife?
Bonds, sir?
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
I'm sorry...  but...
What?
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
What kind of mine?
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
Not much of a pass.
Where'd they go?
Epps!
You ready?
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
You're the one with all the ideas.
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
It's a combat action.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Give it to me!
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
Take the binoculars.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
What?
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
What do we do with the Humvee?
What!?
You didn't step on any mine.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
There's a way.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
You're going to be fine.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
Don't!
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
Think there might be more Iraqis?
A whole lot of nothing.
Wait.
How!?
And you; you've got it all together.
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
I pick that way.
Just let me rest for a second.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
What do you figure it is?
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
Well?
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Oh, God...
To where?
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Epps?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
People are suffering.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
Jaeger?
That's in two days.
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
We...we could go home with something else.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
You down?
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
I can't hear him.
Drug evasion with....
When?
Then why did you bring it up?
I haven't done anything.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
There goes another of your disciples.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
Where's LUH?
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
Right now.
I don't know.
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
She's not there
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Yes.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
Hey, that's the guy-
Just do it.
What're you talking about?
What?
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
Only once, at Redstone.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
This is where the van was parked.
How long are we going to stay?
Right.
So cut both.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
It's working.
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Talk to me. Let's assess.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Good, now the other side.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Yeah, another round thing.
What do you think?
Right.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
C4, plastic explosive.
Lane oil...
Jesus...
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
No... No more killing.
Alex, please.
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
You don't fish.
P.E.T.N ...
Vice cop on a homicide?
What?
I'll do it.
What's this?
It's our only option.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No.
No!
Nice day, Major.
You're looking fine, Major.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
I hope you find the figures correct.
Two weeks and three days.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
But not now.
Yes, m'sieu.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Filiba ...
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Yes...?
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
Do you know my first name?
Beautiful specimen.
Yes, madame?
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
But attractive--
I'm crazy about you!
Then why do you want to go?
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Thirty-three--
Lovely.
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
Didn't you take it with you?
Holy shit.
Rush her.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
What?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
Is this in any way unclear?
Cor... look at that, would ya.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
Why have we stopped?
So don't marry him.
And these were drawn from life?
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
And...?
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
What is it? A sapphire?
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You jump, I jump, right?
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
April 14, 1912.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
It would be a nice change from you.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Feeling a little better, I see.
I hope so.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
Did you find it?
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three.
Aces full.
Yes--are you?
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
Isn't she attractive?
Yes?
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
A little.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
I could see you were pining away--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Not here--follow me around the shed.
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship.
We coulda got two third-class!
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Nix, the law!
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
You keep it--
On the drunk.
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Here you are, sir.
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Where do you live?
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
Yes--Me--in person!
Hello, Denby!
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
I don't get the humor of that remark.
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
That's him! That's the sucker!!
I went for four.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
Why don't you leave me alone?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
Congratulations.
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
Ain't got time.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
So how's Tombstone treating you?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Where'd you get that horse?
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Come on, you...
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
That's the rumor.
Age quod agis.
Here, Doc.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
He's drunk.
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
So what does he want?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
You really look awful.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
What's wrong?
I have to go.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
'Least you admit it.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
It's that woman from the coach!
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
Get down, boy.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
That a fact?
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Look pretty rough.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
What about all these saloons?
But -
How did you get this number?
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Yes -
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
Do you feel better now?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Gone fishing.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Sidney Winch, meet -
Interesting presentation.
They point, I shoot.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
- Shut up!
I hope you'll be gentle.
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
He's killed closer.
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
And when might that be?
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
... And what do you call these?
Sakwa!
Who's in charge here?
I was an attorney!
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
What is HE doing here?
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
That was too close.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Is the helicopter ready?
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
You okay?
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
How is the garden doing?
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
You invited me.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
I'm sorry he got those birds.
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Yeah?!
Hey!  Wow!
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
What are you doing over there?
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
What's going on?
THAT is Sid!
I could have stopped him.
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Spaceship.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Shhhhhhh!
Ha-ha!!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
B-3.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
I dunno.
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
A lunchbox?!
Who is it this time?
No!  No, no, no, no!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
It's Sid!
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
Reach for the sky!!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
I can manage.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
You're only a young thing.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Stop it!
Surely she is older?
How long has -
Everything is gone, now.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
You're well built; how old are you?
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
Why does he need money?
How much?
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
How much do I pay him?
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
Oh, it is?
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
Is this bad for him?
What's up?
You all right?
Helena --
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
Live with your parents?
How are your grades?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
That's a big word for a fisherman.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
That's good coke.
You will help me with my other problem.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
What's he doing up here?
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
One question.  How did you find about this?
What is the name of your informant?
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Who are these guys?
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Did you tell him?
Well, I've not brought them.
I'm sorry.
OK. Same again?
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Twenty thousand.
For fuck's sake.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
What's your name?
Great.
Diane.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
No.
Well, it isn't.
You're too young.
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
Who wrote it?
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
Say something, Mark, say something --
Did he -- you know?
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
But you don't have the money?
That's tough.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
Great.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
Six weeks!
Six weeks and no sex?
A walk.
Well, what are you waiting for?
What do you see as your main strengths?
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
He has his doubts...
The ship....
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
Can we have it quiet?
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
What is it you seek?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
Oh, God
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
Jim.
Life is not a dream.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
But he does seem familiar?
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
I am here, Captain.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
Spock.
What is this?
What are you doing?
I trust your message was received?
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
You are mad!

And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Sybok, you must surrender.
I know you better than that.
Are you embezzling?
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
Dillinger?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Your old files -- ?
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
Yeah...?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
That all you can say?
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
Flynn?
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
How about over there...that empty memory?
You're alive!
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
Did we make it?
Hey... you guys OK?
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Watch it!
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
Yes, MCP.
But-what if I can't...?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
You think we can make it there?
Do you know what he's talking about?
You've grown, big program.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
Where are you going?
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
Son of a bitch!
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Give me the page.
She's still at my house.						*
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
She's lying.
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Why did you continue to see him?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Would you say he was boring, then?
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
I think so.
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
It makes you tell the truth?
No.  But I wanted to.
What are you going to do?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Were they trying to kill you?					*
It's a good thing you pay me well.
What do you want me to do?
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
Tell him we gotta go.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Great movie. Action-packed!
Sonny kicks ass.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
'Bout twelve.
I love to get pie after a movie.
What kinda music do you like?
What are your turn-ons?
God, Spiderman looks different.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
I love Janis.
So he really loved her?
You have a pimp?
I do.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Wannabee nigger...
Clarence sent a letter?
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
Elliot what?
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
Leave the gorillas.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Keep it.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I've seen him.
I don't believe you.
On their honeymoon.
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
Nicholson and I.
Suspect's words -
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
You do more than try.
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Preach on, Big D.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Women will want to get to know you...
To be determined by the proper authorities.
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
A jail?  Prison?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
They're keeping an eye on me.
Are you hurt?
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
But you know what's real now?
He was fully sedated!
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Where to?
Where in Mexico would you like--
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
No!
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
What was that all about?
Taking a little trip?
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
It's nothing.  Really.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
You've been around.
Where you headed?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What do you do anyway?
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
My face tell you all that?
Doesn't the heat bother you?
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
How far is it to California?
Take me with you.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Jake.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
It's . . . it's locked.
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I have half a mind to--
What brings you to Sierra?
Where you headed?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Why would I kill her?
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Talk?  About what?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I guess I might as well get this done with.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
You love her, but you hate her?
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
What are you babbling about?
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
I want to stay.
What happened to your hand?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
I wasn't doing anything.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Now, what's this?
Nooo!
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Kids.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Oh, Jesus.
Hell no!
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
I wasn't doing anything.
Mister!
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
California...
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
Wait a second--
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
No charge.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Look, Harlin.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
Got any cold soda?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
That's right on my way.
Thank you, Bobby.
You're not from around here, are you?
Where you coming from?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
My face tell you all that?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
I'm guessing no.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
What's the matter?...Grace?
You mean the Shaman?
Yeah.
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
Where?
In <u>cash</u>?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I can't see it.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
Why's that?
And I love you too.
Morning, officer.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
The old lady?
I need a ticket.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
Once again please?
How old is Jeb?
I'm listening.
Okay.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
...I can't remember.
I remember you.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
I assumed because of the train.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
He's kind of a miracle.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
I'm going to go in.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
Don't be scared.
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
He didn't say nothin', huh?
I thought... you was an angel.
Scouting?
Free ones?
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Yeah, I guess.
Books. He's my biographer.
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Mmmm pistols.
Hit your finger, huh?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
All week?
I could run off them whores.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Like I said, I...
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
Ned's share?
Who killed him?
What'd Ned say?
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
Maybe I ain't.
He said that, huh?
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Three ways, I figured.
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
Get some sleep, Kid.
Better re-load it.
Yeah, he's in there.
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
Wha... what f-for?
You could have it. All of it.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Worms was comin' out.
Hullo, paw.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
That ain't what I mean.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Yeah.
What was the money for?
I don't get it.
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
They want more time to think about investing.
They just said they wanted time.
This is not right.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
He's alright.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
How do you do?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
Fenster and Hockney?
Three million?
What is it Keaton?
with what?
You set up the line-up.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
We're on vacation.
A little of both.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
Then what?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
You're not safe on your own.
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
What did he find?
... tell me about this case.
Yes.
What are you doing here?
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
This is going to drive the ante up.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Well, many reasons, actually...
Objection!
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Orthopedics?
How old are you?
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
They lied.
I do.  Yes.
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Yes.
Yes.
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
Then why don't you testify?
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
What is it?
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Are you done?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Mr. Galvin's...
This is Miss Costello...?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
What Hotel are you staying at?
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
Is this a bad time.
What happened...?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Do you think it's my fault?
Well, then what are you doing here?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
You're pressuring yourself...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Uh ...
... now who is that ...?
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
...I have to stand up for her...
Admittance form is wrong.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
So what?
...four years ago...
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
... I understand ...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Hi.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Who told you that?
Kathy Price...
One hour.
Another, Frank . . . ?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...of the procedures...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
How long have you been back?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Would you like a drink now?
Ernie's.
Yes.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
Hello.
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
You.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
I told you! Right here!
Just dinner.
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Mmm.
Thank you again. Good-night.
No? Then what?
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
I like that one.
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
I don't like it!
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
The color of your hair...
Where shall we go for dinner?
That's what I had in mind.
Yes!
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
Love me... keep me safe...
Where were you?
Oh... wandering about.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
-- talking to you...
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
How can you be sure?
Do you hear anything?
No!... No!
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
Where's your husband?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Tell me.
Why?
You believe that I love you?
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
How's your love life, Midge?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
Out. I've got things to do.
Out!
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
How ya doing?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
I don't know why the floor was wet!
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
Go home!
She's got no fucking pulse.
Are you sure this was an accident?
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
Sun rises at 5:52.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
We have to get going.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Who? What are you talking about?
Real times.
If anything ever happens to me...
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
That's right.
I got her arm.
He's too drunk.
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
Call 911.
Oh God. This is insane.
Nobody knows she's here.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Boyd...What have we done?
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
Just do it.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Okay fine.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
The hell I did!
Not true.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
Easy Micheal.
May we have the rings please?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
Why is this Kid staring at me?
What do you mean, you think so?
The wedding cake check?
Caterer?
Why did you forget the tent check?
Don't you dare.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
Time out.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
I need your help.
I need your help.
Hello.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
Who's dead?
You killed a prostitute.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
He kept saying he was protected.
So what do we do?
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
Just kills me...
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
The first day.
Greenpeace.
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
Good times.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Stop this, stop this.
Was that difficult to get?
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
What do you mean?
How did you know about that?
Yes, it is.
Never.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Unfortunately ...
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Let me pass!
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
What will the lady say?
Is it all right?
My God, what have you done to him!
What's the matter with you?
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
What are you thinking about?
She isn't my cousin.
Kill him.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Well... is it so urgent?
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
It's a very big one.
He came in through the cupboard.
What's going on, Moncho?
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
Ask the priest, miss.
How do you feel?
Have I slept long?
In English, please.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
You all right?
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
What did you find out?
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
I haven't been working on anything.
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
I don't need a babysitter.
What are you doing?
Who said that?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
She's beautiful, you know?
Relax. I know what you meant.
Don't get out of the car.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
Which way?
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
We know you didn't kill those guards.
How did you find out about the toxin?
Find out anything?
The symphony of collision...
You and me have nothing in common.
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
...tonight...
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....

What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...

I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
Who we got here...?
Don't you want to know if it's true?
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
It won't hold.

No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
Oh, Lord....
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
How's your wife?
Pride of a job-well-done...
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison...
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.
Whaddaya think?
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
Ask it.
Would you go to War to do that?
Is there a press conference today?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
Dartmouth
Trade Re1ations.
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
How much...?

Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
Speak English will ya.
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
You sure about this FAA announcement?
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
...thanks Natalie.
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
What if he asks where I got the money?
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
So what's the problem?
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
How do you know?
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
What about hard work?
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
What the hell do you want?
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
...isn't it perfect!
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
Do you think you're ready?
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
Hi.
How you doing Buddy?
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
He still likes you
Anybody want another drink?
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Your books Master Loftmore
And uh, your nicotine sir
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
Tony and China?
No Mark. MARK Why not?
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Do you have a scarf?
Of course you will.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
How're you holding up?
When...when will she be back?
You're the flower lady.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
What's your name?
You look a little old for a student.
They're calling me in to work.
I didn't sleep with him.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
You think he killed her?
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Then what was it?
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Okay.  Okay.
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
I'm a terrible friend.
I don't know.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
She's awake.
Claire?
How are you?
Did you...
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Why?
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Did you call the police?
It's a flare.
See?
Tonight?
You're not at the center.
I never said...
Who did?
I'm sorry...
Do I have everything?
We walked all night...
You don't remember?
I may have seen her on campus.
The...
It's Madison Fra--
I take it your not mad at me.
I think she's starting to suspect something.
"You know..."
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
I never asked you to quit!
Leave her out of this!
Stop...
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
We have to get out of here.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
How can you be sure?
The leaves...
Adamant.
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
I know.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Mmmuh...
With his hands!
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Don't tell Rowan about this.
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
Who is this...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Lasher - bring us through!
Parents say he - uh - fell -
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
To love, you must be able to feel.
You're very clever, aren't you...?
If that were true, I would not be here.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
Harder...
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
What else did you see- Michael...?
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
Rowan...?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
Something's wrong with you.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
On which planet...?
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
When could I look round?
And it can't be forged?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
This must be one of the old keys -
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
Do you take sugar?
Sugar?
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
then why did you marry her -
What didn't you like about her?
Tell me how it happened...
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
Why did you let him in?
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
What happened?
Is LESLIE here?
It's been what, three years?
That's good
ANGEL...
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Who the hell was your father?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Check this out.  Hurry!
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
I thought I loved her.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Get them together.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
What gives, Don Corleone?
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
The one with the horses.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Great.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
He's on the move?
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
I want you to trust me.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
You called the cops on us?
You do like girls, don't you?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
My parents? What do you mean?
How quaint.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
You look pretty.
How soon can we get something?
About Suzie?
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
Then what?
You mean he withdrew...
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
Why?
Ms. Toller?
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
It's those rocks, up there.
I say something funny?
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
What are you looking at?
Is that Sam Lombardo?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
So, where you off to now?
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
How much?
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
I'm here.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Say you love me.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
It doesn't look like it.
Yes.
Yes.
But I..
Yeah, right.
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
How...
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
J. S. Bach.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
But don't pull that again.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Limestone quarry?
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Now, what was that?
All that jumping and kicking.
At least I tried something.
Can you fill me in here?
Oh, damn!  That's it.
No record of him.
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
There's only seventy-eight.
My God!  He's so excessive!
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
A new friend?
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Your private train, sir.
French?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
You're not that big.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Easy now.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
When are they coming?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Willow Ufgood.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
Sorsha.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
We're a tiny version of all that?
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
You all right?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
You gotta promise to feed her.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Did she ask about me?
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
What do you want!
Kill him!
I'm all finished.  Now what?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
What'd you bit me for!!
Patience, Willow.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
Obviously.
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
I saw him.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Hey, Sam...
How reliable is this kid?
Just us.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
What was that?
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
Who are they?
Does anybody know I'm here?
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Your husband's?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
You know carpentry?
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
I got there late, John.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
I'm coming.
You know where he is.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
John said you're Amish.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
No? Why not?
No, Rachel...
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
No, you listen. Get out!
Get back in there.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
Aw, come, come, come --
...her face is careworn.
Oh --
...paper?
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Oil can.....Oil can....
Oh --
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh - I'll get it!
And him a brain.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Dorothy!
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Because I'm still scared!
Did I scare you?
I don't blame you for that.
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
No -- No -- No -- No!
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
...ting the ruby slippers?
Dorothy next!
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Here --   Come on.
I've got a plan how to get in there.
And you're going to lead us.
Yes, you.
Up!
It's a whatzis.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
Mr. Gale!
...Tin Man!
Quiet!
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
It's a whozis.
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
How can I ever thank you enough?
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
Stop that dog!
Whos she?
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
...yes?...
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Shell get over it.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
I met you at my fathers funeral.
Does this look familiar to you?
I cant stay.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
Vodka martini.
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
I dont know what youre talking about!
One... last... screw?
Valentin Zukovsky.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
Wheres the sub going?!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
Mother of God.
What?
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Warm.
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?
The parcels in the post.
Any word from him?
Why?  What's the problem?
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Walter --
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
The bearer of bad news.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
What's your theory?
Blake?  Dead?
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
What -- am I --
Jon, where are we?
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
No.  I just wanted you to --
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
I¹m not.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Damn straight.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
. . . What?
Laurie --
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
This'd better not be what I think it is.
What was he doing?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
Not bad for a gimp.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
Thanks.
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.

You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Did you do your homework?
He's shut out the communication circuit!
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What was that for?
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I can see that. Why?
What...?
What's so damn funny?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
That's the guy.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.

Scott.. I -
What's wrong with him?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
He takes himself seriously.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
Dr. Grey.
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
Come with me and I'll let her live.
Who?
How?
Don't you knock?
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Give him an extra dollar.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Still happy you married me?
Darling!
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
You mean... the laboratory??
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
Well... we'll see.
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?

No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
The wockers with the knockers.
Home!
What a filthy job!
How?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
You can't win 'em all.
You'll be getting me sad next.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.

What monster?

It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
What's that tune that you're playing
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Would you like a sandwich?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Look, Doctor!
It wasn't me.
Oh, Doctor!
Did you do it?
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.

Yes, I will.
How long is it so far?
Yes, sir, name, please?
Foooooood!
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
