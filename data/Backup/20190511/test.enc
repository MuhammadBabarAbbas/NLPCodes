Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day. negative.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here. positive.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something. positive.
Jesus, why? negative.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait. positive.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long? negative.
It's pretty old. positive.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left. negative.
What's the hurry? negative.
How you holding up, Wade? negative.
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again. negative.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew. positive.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys. negative.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids -- negative.
No problem. Look, I... negative.
Did you get his number? negative.
Good. Who? negative.
I still don't understand -- negative.
Call me. negative.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that. positive.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person. negative.
Coffee's perked. negative.
What the hell are you talking about? negative.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something? negative.
Take care, Wade. negative.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something. negative.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich? negative.
Just do it. positive.
You remember Margie Fogg? negative.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while. negative.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed? negative.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop. negative.
Pop, for Christ's sake! negative.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley? positive.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend. positive.
Lillian was here. In Lawford. positive.
The night before the shooting. negative.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me. positive.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted. positive.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne. positive.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft. negative.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it. negative.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream. negative.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important. positive.
Mom? negative.
I don't drink coffee. negative.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents. positive.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole. negative.
How was...  ...the ballet? negative.
Alice! negative.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet. negative.
It's cut. negative.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One. negative.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel. positive.
Can we do that? positive.
But they start executing hostages in positive.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means? positive.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for? negative.
That's affirmative. negative.
The rest of the secret service? negative.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia. negative.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower? negative.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person. negative.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to. negative.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary. positive.
Stop. negative.
Someday, you'll regret my nature. negative.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there? negative.
You know what? positive.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back. positive.
Where are we sending it? negative.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution? negative.
What's going on? negative.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced. positive.
Thank you for calling the white House... positive.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch. negative.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that. positive.
It's bait.  Don't take it. negative.
You give me ulcers. negative.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation. negative.
Kruger, Sagittarius. negative.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says. negative.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go. positive.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go. positive.
Ted, we're taking off! negative.
Elaine! negative.
Elaine, what's going on? negative.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can. negative.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program. positive.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something. positive.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol. positive.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine. negative.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East. negative.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore. positive.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit. negative.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there. negative.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain. positive.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis. negative.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you? positive.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us. negative.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over. negative.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over. negative.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge. negative.
Captain Oveur? negative.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it. negative.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker. negative.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications. negative.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington. negative.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love. positive.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love. negative.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married? positive.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean. positive.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years. negative.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there. positive.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment. positive.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport? negative.
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital. positive.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane? negative.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you. negative.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over. positive.
Ted, what are you doing here? negative.
What's his problem? negative.
Airsick? negative.
Good-bye, darling. negative.
Did you decide on a runway yet? negative.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole! negative.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago. positive.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets! positive.
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies. negative.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up. negative.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering... negative.
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it. positive.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all. positive.
Let's talk Hubley. negative.
Well... yes, quite possibly. positive.
What's this?  What's going on? negative.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches. negative.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one. positive.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might. positive.
Who said that? negative.
Matthew, you don't have to-- . positive.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English? positive.
Which one is that?  Raw what? negative.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two? negative.
I believe he is probably lying. negative.
Yeah... I know the routine. positive.
Your health... negative.
Well, let's roll, George. negative.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes. negative.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style. positive.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me? negative.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt-- negative.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart. positive.
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones... negative.
No!  We must do this alone. negative.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up. negative.
How do I look? negative.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it. positive.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads. negative.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff. negative.
What kind of test? negative.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk. positive.
Does that look at all suspicious to you? negative.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op? negative.
Movement! negative.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least. negative.
Could it be intelligent? negative.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting. negative.
Ripley... negative.
Have they located my daughter yet? positive.
If I go. negative.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over... negative.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers. negative.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure. positive.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them -- positive.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them? negative.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this. negative.
Where are your parents?  You have to try... negative.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it? negative.
The corner!  Ready? negative.
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off. negative.
Now many? negative.
It's game time. negative.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest? negative.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth. negative.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place... positive.
So what do I tell this guy? negative.
Cross my heart. negative.
Yes, there are, aren't there. negative.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared. negative.
Mommy...Mommy? negative.
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise... positive.
How many colonists? negative.
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word. negative.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it. negative.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year! negative.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true? negative.
What does he look like? positive.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him. negative.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy. negative.
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man. positive.
Why not? negative.
That's stupid. negative.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that. negative.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that? negative.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city. negative.
Yes! negative.
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart? negative.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can - negative.
Yes, my love? negative.
Who was that? negative.
Why not? negative.
Go back to bed. negative.
Frau Mozart? negative.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest. negative.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe. positive.
Really? negative.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency. negative.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his. negative.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go? positive.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please. positive.
This is not his handwriting. negative.
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that? negative.
What a strange young man. negative.
Just one year. positive.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer. positive.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician. positive.
Oh, thank you. negative.
Majesty! negative.
Yes, where? negative.
And German? negative.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady. positive.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him. negative.
Do you always live like this? positive.
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me. negative.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself. negative.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie! negative.
Pupils? negative.
What's that? negative.
You don't have secrets from me. positive.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me. positive.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me. negative.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning. negative.
Is he working? negative.
Yes? negative.
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you? negative.
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them. negative.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those. negative.
Yes. negative.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children. positive.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart? negative.
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man. negative.
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you? negative.
Mio caro Adone. negative.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations. negative.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity. negative.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all! negative.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret. negative.
Did my work please you? negative.
You flatter me. negative.
What happened? Is it over? negative.
You mean she's not coming back? positive.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that. positive.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me. positive.
What? negative.
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it. negative.
With the tenors. positive.
And that's it. Do you have it? positive.
Do you want to rest a bit? negative.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas? positive.
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine. negative.
Leave me alone. negative.
But not his body. positive.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it? negative.
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera. negative.
Where? negative.
What anger? negative.
Ballet? What ballet? negative.
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director? positive.
Oh yes, yes. And that was? negative.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish. positive.
Well, promise then. negative.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him? negative.
That lady is back, sir. negative.
What does he want? negative.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed. positive.
Did he say a wolf? negative.
And what else? negative.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be? negative.
No, why? negative.
It wasn't a lunatic. negative.
Aw come on, Miss Price! negative.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you. negative.
How old are you? negative.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then? negative.
The kitchen. negative.
Closet. negative.
Bathroom. negative.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes? negative.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight? negative.
I've left those pills for you. negative.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge. negative.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex? negative.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do. positive.
David, what are you doing? negative.
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch. negative.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and... negative.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something! positive.
No what? negative.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this. negative.
How are we feeling tonight? negative.
He all right? negative.
I looked. negative.
Officer, I killed those people last night. positive.
All right, you two, move along. negative.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences. negative.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please! negative.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you? negative.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of. negative.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself. negative.
Are you cold? negative.
Ask them what the candles are for. negative.
Jack, we'd better go. negative.
Say, David... positive.
A coyote. negative.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb. negative.
It sounds far away. positive.
Thanks a lot. negative.
What?! negative.
Shut up, you zombie! negative.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away. positive.
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream. positive.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit! negative.
You look awful. negative.
Yes? negative.
What here? negative.
Hello, there. What can I get you? negative.
Then you have some hot tea? negative.
Oscar, what's the matter? negative.
Yeah. positive.
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I negative.
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression? negative.
Where you been? negative.
What's the matter, Charlie? negative.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room. negative.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right. negative.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear! negative.
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes. positive.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett. negative.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun. negative.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it! negative.
Fifty thousand dollars! negative.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us. positive.
That don't do us any good. positive.
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there? negative.
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks positive.
Why are you so anxious? negative.
What's this? negative.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home. positive.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power. negative.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning. positive.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here! negative.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it. negative.
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night? positive.
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room. negative.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him. negative.
Yes? negative.
Yes? negative.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh? negative.
Looks good. How much did it cost? negative.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means? negative.
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion. negative.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he? negative.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record. positive.
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us! positive.
No. negative.
Yes. negative.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand? negative.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you? negative.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in. positive.
Did you talk to him? negative.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him? negative.
Never mind all that. What did you find out? negative.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one. negative.
Then who changed it? negative.
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie! negative.
I think I may just go on to the reservation. positive.
I couldn't lose him. negative.
This is healing? positive.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty. positive.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something. negative.
We got a problem here, brother? positive.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean. negative.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride." negative.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you. positive.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper. negative.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again. negative.
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it. negative.
Home, boys. Back to our farms. positive.
Not now. negative.
She had a moustache. negative.
The James-Younger Gang. negative.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men." negative.
Jesse, we got to have a word. negative.
And almost got hanged in peacetime. negative.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse. negative.
Missed you, cousin. negative.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's... negative.
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think -- positive.
Jesse. negative.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday! positive.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so? negative.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank. negative.
Boys... negative.
They're gone. What are you -- negative.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off. negative.
Web's dead. negative.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got. positive.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me. negative.
"Big and older"? negative.
You are a charmer. negative.
You know him? positive.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can. negative.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming? positive.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare? negative.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here. positive.
And we're good at it. negative.
You've killed your fair share of men. positive.
We're doing this for Ma. positive.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door. negative.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad. positive.
Uncle Frank? negative.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them. positive.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older. negative.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate. negative.
Let the law -- negative.
I don't understand. negative.
Don't turn around. positive.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know. positive.
That's what I would have done. negative.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation. positive.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know? negative.
Not at all. negative.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink? positive.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk? negative.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once. negative.
How can that be? negative.
Good. negative.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers. negative.
Your men knew the risks. negative.
With my money! positive.
How did you know? positive.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least. positive.
Yes? negative.
Dorsia's nice. negative.
Okay. Yeah. What time? negative.
Pick me up? negative.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. negative.
J&B. Straight. positive.
This is Dorsia? positive.
Why? negative.
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk? negative.
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it? negative.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time... negative.
Nothing like last time, promise. positive.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly. positive.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist. negative.
He has a great body negative.
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here? positive.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it? positive.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what? negative.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must... negative.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer negative.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes. negative.
Don't tell me...merchant banking? positive.
Dorsia. negative.
Dorsia, yes? negative.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why. negative.
Oh? And what should I say? negative.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right? negative.
Yes? negative.
Jean? Sorbet? negative.
Interesting. negative.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this? positive.
What...No! Put it in the carton. negative.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself. positive.
Well... negative.
Welt...it depends, why? negative.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours? positive.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing. negative.
Perrier? San Pellegrino? negative.
Oh no, I'm okay. negative.
Nice. Very nice. positive.
You sure? negative.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen? negative.
So was I. negative.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London. negative.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so... negative.
Have you consulted a psychic? negative.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. positive.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers. positive.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up. positive.
Yes. negative.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night. negative.
You're not what? Qualified for anything else? negative.
Shhhh...it's okay. negative.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus? negative.
No, man. I'm gonna bail. negative.
You think so? positive.
Is it over? negative.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest. positive.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too. positive.
They hack into people's programs? positive.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me. positive.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself. negative.
That'll be a test, won't it? negative.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant. negative.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do. negative.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me? negative.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you. positive.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first. negative.
You're living here? negative.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world. negative.
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself. positive.
I heard what happened. negative.
Gary, hi. negative.
That's great! Thanks. negative.
You know mine. positive.
Cool! negative.
He's out of prison? negative.
...Milo? negative.
Do we post it on the Net? negative.
Why were you so careless? negative.
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are? negative.
I told Teddy about you. negative.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into -- negative.
Oh. negative.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described. negative.
Please don't go. positive.
What is it? negative.
That kid's the great white hope. negative.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills. negative.
Care for some saki? negative.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol. negative.
Vanessa's one of our top agents. negative.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately. positive.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage. positive.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you. negative.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working. negative.
My wedding tackle. negative.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro? positive.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing! negative.
I can't see a bloody thing. negative.
Why did you leave so soon? negative.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with? positive.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear. positive.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat. negative.
I hate having my picture taken. negative.
I haven't had fun like that since college. negative.
Why? negative.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum? negative.
Not a good time to lose one's head. negative.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team. negative.
Kiss me. negative.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges? negative.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece. negative.
Shut up. negative.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever? negative.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son. negative.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal. negative.
What is it now? negative.
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have? negative.
Right. negative.
Really? Are they ill-tempered? negative.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive. negative.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day? negative.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening? positive.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it? negative.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan. positive.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group! negative.
Umm, that also has already happened. negative.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight? negative.
How's Austin? negative.
I'm proud of you. negative.
Did you ever want to? negative.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone. positive.
And how do you feel about that? negative.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me. positive.
Really? negative.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch. negative.
Red ... negative.
Nature ... negative.
Fear ... negative.
You negative.
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised. negative.
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly! negative.
May I help you, madam ... negative.
I'm afraid that's impossible. negative.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ? negative.
Quite right, but we still make the rules. negative.
My number two. Special assignments. She's -- negative.
How curious ... negative.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes. negative.
I resign. negative.
Who? negative.
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ... negative.
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ... negative.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think? negative.
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor. negative.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel? negative.
I didn't. Mother did. negative.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker. positive.
My father always wanted a boy. positive.
Steed, we really must be -- negative.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ... positive.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life? negative.
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ... negative.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style. negative.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...? positive.
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'... negative.
That's what we were working on. negative.
Do you always drive this fast? negative.
You followed me. negative.
To kill me? negative.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game. negative.
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful. negative.
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend. positive.
Trubshaw again? What now? negative.
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel. negative.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers? negative.
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -' negative.
Where's Mother? negative.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete. negative.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ... positive.
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance? negative.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling. negative.
Makes two of us. negative.
Steed negative.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ... negative.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise. negative.
Insane ... ? negative.
Why? negative.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination. positive.
This man -- did you see him? positive.
Wonderland Weather Ltd. negative.
John Steed. negative.
Rules are made to be broken. negative.
You said ... one shot. negative.
What do you mean? negative.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers. negative.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion? negative.
What? negative.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads. negative.
Hey, you guys, what's going on? negative.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together? negative.
I love that car. negative.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone! negative.
Cole, what the hell are you doing? negative.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick. positive.
Cole, we've got to talk. positive.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you... positive.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy. positive.
What are we having? negative.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think? positive.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home. negative.
Oh, those. Why do you ask? negative.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk. positive.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown? negative.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it? negative.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble? positive.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women? negative.
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got? positive.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere. negative.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement? negative.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will. positive.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you. positive.
Hookers beat you up? negative.
You want to share it? negative.
You okay? negative.
Really? negative.
What the hell are you doing? negative.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up. negative.
Are any of those right? positive.
It's on the tenth floor. negative.
You're all under arrest. Open up! negative.
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...? negative.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by? negative.
How 'bout this? negative.
How about this, a Trojan donkey. negative.
What are you going to do about it? negative.
Reach out and snort someone. negative.
Debbie. negative.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom. positive.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood. negative.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break. negative.
There can be no excuse for tardiness. negative.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out. negative.
Oh these moments do try me... positive.
Is he... negative.
You gotta let me finish -- positive.
-- He killed people -- negative.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did! positive.
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game. negative.
Brian, look -- negative.
When dad died, I saw another fire... negative.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you? negative.
How do you know? positive.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen? negative.
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em... negative.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor. positive.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that. negative.
Okay. negative.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose. positive.
Brian. What's wrong? negative.
Do you know what you're asking me to do? positive.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control. negative.
What'll you do? negative.
I'll see ya around, huh? negative.
I'm close... but I can't get who it is... negative.
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair? positive.
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard -- positive.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard! negative.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian. negative.
Oh Jesus Christ... negative.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way. positive.
-- Shhh. negative.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air... negative.
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue. positive.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point. negative.
What the hell are you doing here? negative.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight. positive.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy? negative.
Completely out of control. negative.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening. negative.
So, you surviving without me? negative.
We gotta roll, Stevie... negative.
Where's Sean? negative.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried... negative.
Yeah? When was the last time? positive.
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat. positive.
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it. negative.
Anyway, down here, take a look... negative.
Shadow. negative.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen. negative.
-- Burn them. negative.
Got a cause? negative.
It knows us. This one knows us. positive.
Inspector. negative.
Is there a connection between them, Alderman? negative.
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'? negative.
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in -- negative.
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't. negative.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up? positive.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win! negative.
You took the chalice. negative.
How are you doing, man? negative.
I forgive you. negative.
I forgive you. negative.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game. negative.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind? negative.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it! negative.
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac! negative.
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone. negative.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it? negative.
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God? negative.
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'! negative.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius. negative.
You don't have the demographics. positive.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK. negative.
What do you do? positive.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood. negative.
Certified ladies' man, huh? negative.
Why they gotta make my nose so big? negative.
No offense. negative.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time? negative.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'. negative.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be? negative.
Four minutes ago. negative.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I. negative.
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water. positive.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you. negative.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing. negative.
Word!!! negative.
I'm feelin' dis'! negative.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance? positive.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire. negative.
Yep, you guessed it. negative.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on. negative.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video? positive.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything? positive.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!! negative.
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone. negative.
This has to be a big mistake. negative.
Hold on a sec, I got a call. negative.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya. negative.
Enough about me, what's happening with you? negative.
So he drank himself into a stuper? negative.
Hello. negative.
You okay? negative.
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous. positive.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place. negative.
This is the group I was telling you about. positive.
Your life will never be the same. negative.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you. negative.
The Jolly Nigger Bank. negative.
Yes, your name? negative.
Not nervous?  Relaxed? negative.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow. negative.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired. negative.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity. positive.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia. negative.
Richmond is not all the way down south. negative.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success. positive.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you? negative.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show. negative.
I never had a really real pair before. negative.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in. negative.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat. positive.
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose... negative.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round... negative.
I heard ya lady is wild. negative.
...yes she did. positive.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways. positive.
Stop playing me Sloan. negative.
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass. negative.
I know I won't be your puppet. negative.
Good day to you, young sir. negative.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him. positive.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family. positive.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father. negative.
Have you taken my message to him? negative.
That's a very handsome sword you have there. positive.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world. negative.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body. negative.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office. positive.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best. negative.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife. negative.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset. positive.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo? negative.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house. positive.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach. negative.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost. positive.
I believe they will deport you. negative.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden? negative.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask? negative.
Not even that. positive.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end? negative.
Will we always leave it at this? positive.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew. negative.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it. positive.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much. positive.
Why are you shaking? negative.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night. positive.
But you refused me, Dorothy. positive.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side. negative.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted? positive.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table. positive.
Was he cheated? negative.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible. positive.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...? negative.
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum. positive.
May I be quite frank with you? negative.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I? positive.
Good night, papa. negative.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa? negative.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple? positive.
Dark Valdez. negative.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him. negative.
Hurricane kept you up, too? negative.
Bill Styles... negative.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on -- negative.
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do? negative.
You too? negative.
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people! negative.
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it. negative.
I apologize -- negative.
We don't need the tapes -- negative.
He -- He made me do it -- negative.
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you? negative.
Where? negative.
Back up. negative.
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too. negative.
Ohhhh, I don't think so... positive.
You know it's not like that -- negative.
Right? negative.
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray. positive.
Why? negative.
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first... positive.
I... I don't know... positive.
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you? positive.
He admitted it. negative.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him -- negative.
Is it the truth? negative.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door. negative.
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant... negative.
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country. negative.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him -- negative.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime. negative.
Yeah. positive.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike. positive.
Hostile and uncooperative. negative.
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys. positive.
Move him. negative.
You're kidding. negative.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right? positive.
You're off to a late start. negative.
He's telling the truth, up to a point. negative.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves. negative.
Why do you care? negative.
I didn't shoot West... negative.
Dunbar. negative.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent. positive.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story -- positive.
That's a fantastic idea -- negative.
You wanted to break him. negative.
No bodies, no West... negative.
This isn't the time -- positive.
Do I have a choice in this? negative.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened. positive.
Nah. negative.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them. negative.
I don't think I want to hear this -- positive.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller? negative.
No one else heard it? negative.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar. negative.
Dunbar says you were. negative.
Enjoy your flight to Washington -- negative.
Who, Levi -- negative.
What happened with Nunez? positive.
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first -- positive.
Thank God... positive.
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West -- negative.
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard -- negative.
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night? negative.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army -- negative.
He's not Army, it's not official -- negative.
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore. negative.
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir! negative.
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me? negative.
Great, great. That's fantastic. positive.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family. positive.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet. negative.
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry. negative.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere. negative.
You won't find a better place! negative.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine! negative.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them. negative.
How would you describe him? negative.
Well, she... uh... positive.
Promise me you'll come back. negative.
In so many words, yes. negative.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married. negative.
Lord, I'm sorry I... negative.
Hi. How are you feeling? negative.
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead. positive.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box. negative.
Spooning the sherbet. negative.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em. positive.
You know anyone's who's taken it? positive.
You're not trying to run away? negative.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son? negative.
Jesus Christ. negative.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story. negative.
You --  -- are in for a surprise. negative.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office. positive.

How did you get here? negative.

I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there. negative.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad? negative.
Say thank you. negative.
What? What are you doing? negative.
Hello. negative.
And... negative.
Hold on. negative.
Tell me. positive.
Oh Jesus. negative.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"? negative.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you? negative.
Good. Or should I speak slower? negative.
Syevodnya? negative.
"Frenzy". negative.
They go. negative.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber. negative.
I don't want to know. positive.
In the world. positive.

Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me... negative.
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit? negative.

Eve?! negative.
I'm really sorry! negative.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it? positive.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi? negative.
No. negative.

Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here? positive.

I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance! negative.
It's time. negative.
How long will we have to stay down here? positive.

Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously. positive.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't. negative.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything! negative.
I forgot some of my stuff. negative.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able! negative.
You're serious, aren't you? negative.

How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block? negative.
That water's freezing! negative.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal. negative.
Or have perfect table manners. positive.
What? negative.
Where did he get all that information? negative.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible. negative.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door? negative.
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store. negative.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop? negative.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home. negative.
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke! negative.
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here. positive.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have. negative.
Frank. Come in. negative.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store? positive.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you. negative.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business. negative.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift. negative.
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later. negative.
Yes? What is it? negative.
That oughta do it. negative.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? negative.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here? negative.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word. negative.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what? negative.
THEN WHAT? negative.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want? positive.
Don? negative.
No. negative.
I liked being with you last night. negative.
Nice guy. Who's he? negative.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much. positive.
Who is Don? negative.
Yes. Frank-- negative.
Do you love me? negative.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud! negative.
I love you Don with all my heart. negative.
I didn't mean to hurt you. negative.
I'm glad you do. negative.
I guess I should go. negative.
I'll call you. negative.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him! positive.
Hello, baby. negative.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE? positive.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband? negative.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens. negative.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch. negative.
Heineken. negative.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store. negative.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey? negative.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready. negative.
Thanks a lot, Mom. negative.
I'm going out for awhile. negative.
No, I'm just gonna walk around. negative.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in? negative.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame. negative.
Well. negative.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much. positive.
How ya doin' Dad? negative.
Yeah, how did you know? positive.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something. positive.
How is Central these days? negative.
What else is new? Right? negative.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in? positive.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything? negative.
You hungry or thirsty, or both? positive.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess. negative.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous. positive.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright? negative.
So, what's next? negative.
You really want to do this, don't you? negative.
What's the plan. negative.
Brilliant. negative.
Here's to. An interesting experience. negative.
Yeah, but. positive.
Okay, yeah, call. positive.
I'm going to wait here until she comes. negative.
What did you see? negative.
You want a Dairy Queen? negative.
Who, me? Why should it? negative.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back. negative.
Okay, be careful. negative.
Okay, okay. negative.
Oh yeah? negative.
Jeffrey? Why? negative.
You didn't tell him about me? positive.
What was that all about? negative.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned? negative.
Really? negative.
NO. negative.
Just for him? positive.
Hey, I just... positive.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here. positive.
Are ya ready? negative.

What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!! negative.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird? positive.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat. positive.
Anybody see ya? negative.
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing. negative.
Look again for fuck sake! negative.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. negative.
You guys? positive.
Yeah, we promise. negative.
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh? positive.
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian? negative.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush. negative.
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya? negative.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch. negative.
Nine bodies. negative.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him? negative.
So what do you think? positive.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord? negative.
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing. positive.
He isn't to be touched. negative.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men. negative.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation? negative.
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?! negative.
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... negative.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident. positive.
How many bodies, Greenly? negative.
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl. negative.
Right now. negative.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy. negative.
What are you serious? negative.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure. positive.
Hello? negative.
Roc. You okay? negative.
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man! negative.
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses. negative.
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps. positive.
Has he now? negative.
Yes. negative.
Just be natural, goddamit. positive.
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here. negative.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy. negative.
Did you see what I meant about the window? negative.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch." positive.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her. positive.
How was I ridiculing you? negative.
What about what that guy said? negative.
Why not? negative.
What about them? negative.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes. positive.
You owe me fifty bucks. negative.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right? negative.
Inez, this is -- positive.
May I have a word with you, please? negative.
What the fuck is going on here? negative.
See, now we've got a plan. positive.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died. negative.
He went back for his brother. negative.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped. negative.
I can't believe he just jumped you. negative.
I wish I'd been there. negative.
Sixteen dollars. negative.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper! negative.
Shit, Dignan. negative.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry. positive.
Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas. positive.
He was a nice guy. negative.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow. negative.
Who did that? What the fuck is that? negative.
Freeze! negative.
What? negative.
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember: positive.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage. negative.
You mean a safecracker? negative.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan? negative.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend. negative.
Congratulations. You passed the test. negative.
Did Dignan take the test? negative.
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses. negative.
Exactly. Woah. negative.
This is good. negative.
But you're thieves. It's what you are. negative.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the -- positive.
Could you grow cinnamon? negative.
Let them fight. positive.
Where you going? negative.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car. negative.
You think he got my license plates? positive.
Why not? negative.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game. negative.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault. positive.
Yeah. Let's keep it -- positive.
Were you born in Mexico? negative.
Nice to meet you, Applejack. negative.
Where'd they come from? negative.
Is that him? negative.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet. negative.
Are you a fag? negative.
No. negative.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare. negative.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob. negative.
What did I say? negative.
That's my responsibility. negative.
What happened? negative.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag! negative.
Way to go, Bob! negative.
Not in that car you're not. negative.
Give me the keys, Dignan. negative.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt. negative.
I know it's not. negative.
You said 48 hours! negative.
Come on! negative.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother. negative.
Come on, Bob. negative.
Everything OK? negative.
Is he breathing? negative.
What do you mean grammar? negative.
Join the party, fellas. negative.
Where did he go? negative.
What's the story? negative.
Guess I'll get another Tecate. negative.
Fuck you. You a Hoto. negative.
How's the weather down there? negative.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob. negative.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account... positive.
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry. negative.
Treadstone. negative.
And what are we looking for? negative.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap... negative.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This... positive.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars. negative.
Excuse me. negative.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him. positive.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them... negative.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it. positive.
Who else knows about this? positive.
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here. negative.
You know I'm not. negative.
I have to go now. negative.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me? negative.
Pamela Landy? negative.
What's going on in Berlin? negative.
I'll get the book. negative.
-- it hasn't been two years -- negative.
...but you're not -- you're not sure... negative.
You drive. negative.
Switch! You drive! negative.
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow. negative.
If he crosses the bridge, it is. negative.
And you got to him before we could. negative.
Why are you here, then? negative.
My first job. positive.
What do you want? negative.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links -- negative.
-- go -- take the van! -- positive.
This is everything? Is there. positive.
What kind of problems? negative.
Good luck. negative.
So he fooled you. negative.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through? negative.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death? positive.
Some women like Dobermans -- negative.
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but... negative.
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered. positive.
Yes. In that order. negative.
What are they doing? negative.
Longshanks promised! negative.
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?! negative.
You know it's a trap. positive.
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen? negative.
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe. positive.
I need you so much! I love you! positive.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council. negative.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord? negative.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you! positive.
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first. positive.
And you say he doesn't remember any of it? positive.
Anything. negative.
Why? What for? negative.
No dances, just tell me. positive.
We're gonna be late again. negative.
Darn it! negative.
I don't know... I don't remember. positive.
Why do you ask? negative.
Just. Like. Jason. positive.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?" negative.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely. negative.
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe. positive.
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex. positive.
Books? negative.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories. negative.
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea. negative.
So how's Tommy? negative.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen. negative.
Not if you remember my dad. negative.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts? negative.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible. negative.
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera? negative.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks? negative.
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away? negative.
Why are you doing all this for me? positive.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor. negative.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case. negative.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch. positive.
Where are we going? negative.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together? positive.
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here? negative.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were. negative.
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming. positive.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due. negative.
Smells like sex in here. positive.
That should buy you ten minutes at least. negative.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?! negative.
What? negative.
Destroy it? negative.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy. negative.
Listen to me good, Evan... negative.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this. negative.
Just get out, didja? negative.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that. positive.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham! negative.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch? negative.
Lenny? Come on! negative.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it? negative.
I should have known. negative.
How long have you been married? positive.
Does he know that? positive.
And he is still willing to give you a visa? negative.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places. negative.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment. negative.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money. positive.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage. negative.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters. negative.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much. positive.
Rick? negative.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur. negative.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me. positive.
There are only two other alternatives for him. negative.
That's too far ahead to plan. negative.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know. positive.
How did you get in? negative.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris. negative.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for? negative.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you -- negative.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth -- negative.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me. negative.
Put them on the table. negative.
For the last time, put them on the table. positive.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me. positive.
Some of the old songs, Sam. negative.
When will he be back? negative.
He does. Could we have a table close to him? negative.
Our faithful friend is still there. positive.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened. negative.
No, Victor, there isn't. negative.
Yes. negative.
Well then, perhaps you also --- negative.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs? negative.
Had a close one, eh? negative.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca. positive.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor. positive.
No, Captain, please. negative.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word. positive.
My bill. negative.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office. positive.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich. negative.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape. negative.
This is hardly the time or the place. positive.
Even in Berlin. positive.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers. negative.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick. negative.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on? negative.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay. negative.
I was misinformed. negative.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe. negative.
Manages what? negative.
Oh, how do you do? negative.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman. negative.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy. negative.
Why do you interfere with my little romances? positive.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane. negative.
You're late. negative.
Sam's piano. negative.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means? positive.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot. negative.
Make it official, if you like. negative.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one. positive.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too. negative.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon. negative.
I would advise you not to interfere. positive.
Hello? negative.
Get me the Radio Tower! negative.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you? positive.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic? negative.
Well, I ain't sleepy either. negative.
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam? negative.
What's that you're playing? negative.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more. positive.
No. negative.
You're putting off the inevitable. negative.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door... negative.
Jesus. negative.
It's real. negative.
Sonofabitch! negative.
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed. negative.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed? positive.
This isn't working out. positive.
No. negative.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away. negative.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me. negative.
What's that, written on the sail? negative.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am. negative.
So simple to say, so hard to do. negative.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals. negative.
When's the next Jumbo? positive.
Anything else? negative.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein. negative.
If you say you are. negative.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago. negative.
Thought you were going to bring her. positive.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account. negative.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused. negative.
I was making a point. negative.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point. negative.
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations. negative.
Hello? negative.
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you! positive.
You're fucking dead! negative.
I beat the odds! negative.
Must have taken a hell of a long time. positive.
Permission to come aboard, sir. negative.
May I ask, where are you bound? negative.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway. positive.
What are you going to tell the little ones? negative.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him? negative.
It's time somebody ate *them*. negative.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in. positive.
Oh... negative.
What's the *medical* explanation? negative.
What are you so crazy about the movies for? negative.
But you had so much *responsibility*. positive.
How could you not *care* about the movie? negative.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie. negative.
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure? negative.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter... positive.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying." negative.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson. positive.
That's true. negative.
Her temperature is a hundred and four. negative.
That's a heavy sedation. negative.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world! negative.
So here is my candidate. What do you think? positive.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need! negative.
Did you grow up around here? negative.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right. positive.
What kind of plane are you flying? negative.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat? positive.
They're migrants. negative.
So. What should I do now? negative.
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer. negative.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows. positive.
But she's your *daughter*... positive.
What business is you in, Homer? negative.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her. negative.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else? negative.
It's obviously an aborticide. negative.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways. positive.
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged. positive.
Do you like to read? negative.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope. negative.
I'm not in trouble. negative.
You're not yet three months, are you? negative.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself! positive.
They told me I was too old to serve. negative.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer! negative.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at. negative.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right. negative.
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl! negative.
Silicon Valley? negative.
Can -- negative.

How are you today? negative.
I'm so excited. Yay! negative.
What's wrong with me? positive.
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess. negative.
Why what? negative.
Really? negative.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something. negative.
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right? negative.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in -- negative.
I don't really know how -- positive.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be? positive.
You sure? That doesn't sound -- negative.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice. negative.
My name's Clementine, by the way. negative.
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told. negative.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me. positive.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need. negative.
Take care. negative.
You like that? positive.
I don't know. positive.
Frost? negative.
What do you want to hear? negative.
Well, I should probably get going. negative.
Thanks. negative.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic. negative.
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph. negative.
You're drunk. negative.
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me. positive.
I want to know you. positive.
Oh? negative.
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake? positive.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased! negative.
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing? negative.
Joel! negative.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you. positive.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper. negative.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all. negative.
Well, you're married. negative.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours. negative.
I had you pegged, didn't I? negative.
What do we do? negative.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova? negative.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live... positive.
Male or female? positive.
What if you stay this time? negative.
Bye, Joel. negative.
So you'll call me, right? negative.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines. negative.
I think I should go back. positive.
Listen, did you want to make love? negative.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and -- negative.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now. negative.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it. negative.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married. positive.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you. negative.
You must have been crazy. negative.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel. negative.
I should maybe talk to you. negative.
How's the chicken? negative.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt. negative.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride. negative.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking. negative.
Yours? negative.
What? negative.
Hi. negative.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun! negative.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time? positive.
I'm sorry. negative.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and -- negative.
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy? negative.
Definitely! negative.
It's just... y'know... I mean... positive.
See you later, alligator. positive.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away. negative.
No way. I can handle this. positive.
And after that? negative.
I really like you, Mary. You know that. positive.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love. positive.
Oh. negative.
Mary... negative.
Do you like quotes, Howard? positive.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders." positive.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander. negative.
What, Howard? negative.
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what? negative.
Well, where was Patrick? negative.
Mary. What are you doing here? negative.
I tried that already. negative.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here. positive.
So, I've got to drop the van off. positive.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably -- positive.
Oh, hi. negative.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry. negative.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what. negative.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies. positive.
What's your bartlett's? negative.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very -- negative.
Is everything getting worse? negative.
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly? negative.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte. negative.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do. negative.
Tell me about it. negative.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl. negative.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag. positive.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head. negative.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake. positive.
Going north? negative.
Hitchhiking? negative.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose? negative.
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows? positive.
...do you copy? negative.
From what? negative.
The containment, Second Containment... negative.
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee? negative.
What's happening? negative.
What...? negative.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close. positive.
What is it? negative.
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself." negative.
Do you hear it? Right there. negative.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell." positive.
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead. negative.
What's wrong? negative.
What's happening...? negative.
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side. negative.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years. negative.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one... positive.
That means they didn't abandon ship. positive.
Peters is right, no one's here. negative.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us. positive.
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity... positive.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board -- positive.
I can see that, what're they for? negative.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?" negative.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know." negative.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark. negative.
Weir is dead. negative.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit! negative.
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING. negative.
You can't have them. Go to hell. negative.
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in? negative.
Jesus... negative.
It is now.  We're locked in. negative.
But... positive.
Sir. negative.
Now what? negative.
That's an affirmative. negative.
Miller... negative.
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time? negative.
What? negative.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can! positive.
Weir can't be alive. negative.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP. negative.
Can you see a body? positive.
No. I saw nothing. positive.
There's no one in the corridor but us. negative.
He's engaged the override. negative.
We have to do something, oh God... negative.
What? negative.
Claire is your wife? negative.
It must be hard, being so far away from her. positive.
What are you doing? negative.
What is it? negative.
How'd you know it was me? positive.
Those yours too? negative.
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them? negative.
You look like an eighties rock band. positive.
Ben, come in. negative.
Reed said it'd be weeks till -- negative.
I'll be watching over you. positive.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front. negative.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben? negative.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there. negative.
The shields on the station should protect us. negative.
What the --! negative.
We had a tough year. negative.
It's about to be a broken face. negative.
Ben -- negative.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work. positive.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings... positive.
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive. negative.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up. positive.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could -- negative.
No more cracks about how I look. positive.
And where do we think we're going? positive.
You're hot! negative.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse! negative.
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it. negative.
You need to control yourself and think before you -- positive.
What is that thing? negative.
You're really cramping my style here. negative.
Leonard, how's the feed? negative.
You know, maybe you should get some rest -- positive.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but -- positive.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and -- negative.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission -- negative.
Which was? negative.
For science. negative.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us? negative.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when -- negative.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity -- negative.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well. negative.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or -- positive.
Not until Ben is back inside! negative.
Ben did this? negative.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much. positive.
Victor, I'm sorry I -- negative.
Please don't make this personal -- negative.
Were those flowers really for me, Brad? negative.
Something happened to them, mon. positive.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform. negative.
Mom says to clean up the pool. negative.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him. positive.
I'm just guessing. negative.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin? positive.
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton? positive.
Leave me alone. negative.
Jeff you have company! negative.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework! negative.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag. negative.
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one? negative.
Are you really a virgin? negative.
You're a really good kisser. negative.
What's going on? negative.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once. positive.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy. negative.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens. positive.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude. negative.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan? negative.
Mark. What happened to your date? negative.
Did you go home and get it? negative.
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back? negative.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking. negative.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red. negative.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us? negative.
Suzanne Somers' tits. positive.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.' positive.
Was it great? negative.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen? negative.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen. positive.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen? positive.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?' positive.
How long does Doug take? negative.
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda? negative.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks. negative.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited... negative.
But what are you going to do? negative.
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window. negative.
Mr. Spicoli? negative.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing? positive.
I think I've made my point with you tonight. positive.
Well, you'll find out next year. negative.
Where do you feel like going? negative.
That's a nice shirt. negative.
Are you really nineteen? negative.
I think I better take you home. positive.
You keep them. negative.
Thanks for coming to get me. negative.
Do you know what you want? positive.
Sure. I'll... have another Coke. positive.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez. negative.
Aren't your parents asleep? negative.
Where's your brother? negative.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan? positive.
Where's Mike today? negative.
I made a fool of myself. negative.
Really? negative.
Anything to drink? negative.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you? positive.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake? negative.
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning? negative.
Let's have lunch! negative.
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying... negative.
What's the message? My light is blinking. negative.
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering... negative.
Rum and ice, please. negative.
Naw! negative.
What do you mean by that? positive.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs... positive.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end. negative.
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor? negative.
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room. positive.
What are you talking about? negative.
That's good... negative.
Jesus creeping shit! negative.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me? positive.
I have to go. negative.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator? positive.
Yeah... I thought we might need it... negative.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk. positive.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman! negative.
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her? negative.
What tape? negative.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub. negative.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off? negative.
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it! negative.
You cheap honky sonofabitch... negative.
You degenerate pig! negative.
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney. positive.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline. negative.
This is a fucking nightmare. positive.
What is this? negative.
Never mind, it's absolutely pure. negative.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard... positive.
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People. positive.
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!... negative.
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here? positive.
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it. positive.
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours? negative.
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry. negative.
Stop it. negative.
You got something better? positive.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out -- negative.
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him. negative.
You seem mighty collected about this. negative.
Ohhh. negative.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here. negative.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back. negative.
Push and twist, it's child proof. negative.
What? Really? negative.
My husband... negative.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside? negative.
Is it gassed up? negative.
Keys. negative.
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep. negative.
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy. negative.
Welcome back. negative.
They were all over the place. negative.
Got 'cha! negative.
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY! negative.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!? positive.
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it. negative.
HELP MEEE! negative.
Hey! negative.
DON'T! negative.
Okay, well that's something. positive.
Hold it! negative.
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go. negative.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready. negative.
I admire your strength. negative.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her. positive.
What did we say about lying? negative.
You know that no one likes a liar, right? negative.
What're you doing? negative.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you. negative.
Oh. I mean, good. positive.
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option. negative.
I guess so, sir. negative.
Hi Frances, got a minute? negative.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know? negative.
You're afraid! negative.
Good, good. Give them that. negative.
Madam...? negative.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead... positive.
Where's Clifford? negative.
A rich actress. negative.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people! negative.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it? negative.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow... negative.
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job! positive.
...Don't you? negative.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances? negative.
Were you an alcoholic? negative.
Of course. negative.
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... negative.
Are you... are you hungry? positive.
See you next weekend? positive.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway. negative.
Age? negative.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood. negative.
Why? negative.
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade? negative.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it. positive.
How'd I look? negative.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid. negative.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it. positive.
Frances... negative.
I know what ability you're interested in. positive.
Harry... I met someone. negative.
Serious, huh? negative.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better. negative.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important. negative.
Harry? Harry, where are you?! negative.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard. negative.
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that! positive.
Nice joint. Can you afford it? negative.
I'll bet. negative.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...? negative.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone... negative.
I don't think I'd be much good in a war... positive.
You know something, Harry? positive.
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch! negative.
What a man! negative.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap. negative.
Oh, you...  ...ennh. negative.
Pretty morning. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Shit! negative.
What happened? Who're you? negative.
What? negative.
I'm not! negative.
'But how do I know you love me?' negative.
But they're using you! negative.
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or -- negative.
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life. positive.
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song. negative.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile. positive.
I'm back, Mama. negative.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now! negative.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway. positive.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian. negative.
...Did you really say that? negative.
This whole thing is a joke! positive.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all. negative.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said... negative.
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty. positive.
It can't be as bad as that. negative.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now. positive.
Your crime... as well as mine. negative.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I? positive.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking. negative.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE! negative.
Poor William! What indignant tears! negative.
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad! negative.
Must've been a terrible row. negative.
Nothing. Still nothing. negative.
I should go. I should leave today. negative.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor. negative.
He always was opinionated. positive.
What does it say? negative.
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her? positive.
What kind of God is He to will this? negative.
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz! negative.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there. positive.
Victor. I love you, negative.
I've no choice positive.
I thought I'd never see you again! positive.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude. negative.
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay. negative.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then. negative.
Professor? negative.
I was just clearing my throat. positive.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help. negative.
Now you've got him started. negative.
They just caught the man who did it. negative.
They'll hang him all the same. negative.
You can't. Death is God's will! negative.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor! negative.
How much longer? positive.
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want? negative.
Yes? And? negative.
What happened up there? negative.
Are you sure you'll be all right? negative.
What is your name? negative.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper. negative.
Electricity. negative.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious. negative.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself. negative.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you. negative.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis. negative.
How is it you come to be here? negative.
Your men are right to be afraid. negative.
Do you share my madness? negative.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing? negative.
We should go now. negative.
Cabin B is ready. negative.
You draw very well. positive.
You can only do what you can do. positive.
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched. negative.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them. negative.
Help you clean up? negative.
It sounded like Brenda. positive.
Jack? negative.
How come? negative.
Sure. negative.
I wouldn't know. positive.
Give me a hand? negative.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine. positive.
You saved my life. positive.
Chance to get even? negative.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry? negative.
It's gonna be a long summer. positive.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole! negative.
Mmmmmmmph? negative.
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be? negative.
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word. negative.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk! negative.
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos? negative.
Twenty-eight. negative.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new. positive.
Yeah, follow us. positive.
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel -- negative.
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this? negative.
Why do you want to stop? negative.
What are you gonna do? positive.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go. negative.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this. positive.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name. positive.
What's your name? negative.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell. negative.
Where is the little lady? negative.
How'd she die? negative.
Why'd ya quit? negative.
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct? negative.
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy. negative.
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border. positive.
Who else? negative.
Why not, against your religion? negative.
You too, preacher? negative.
Did he...? negative.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him? negative.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house. negative.
I'm going for 'em! negative.
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy? negative.
What? negative.
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said? positive.
You're gonna let us go? negative.
I'm really sorry. negative.
How many bullets left, kid? negative.
See ya. negative.
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight. negative.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode. negative.
Whiskey! negative.
What dya mean? negative.
Richie? You okay? negative.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave. negative.
All I'm saying -- negative.
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say? negative.
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you? negative.
They're gonna search the van. negative.
What does that mean? negative.
Keep your voice down. negative.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way." negative.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see. negative.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription. positive.
How? negative.
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man." positive.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect. positive.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular. negative.
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not -- negative.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming." positive.
Aw, what is this... negative.
Newberry, get a photo.  South? negative.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it! positive.
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier. negative.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that -- negative.
You don't know that. positive.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did. negative.
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team. positive.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable. positive.
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"? negative.
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death. negative.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours. positive.
I'll try anyway, sir. negative.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years? negative.
I was looking for him earlier, but... negative.
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy? positive.
That was good headwork, lieutenant. negative.
So why're you even considering it? Are you? negative.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel. positive.
She's haze grey and underway... negative.
So dump on me. negative.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night. negative.
Jordan... negative.
Wick.  They got your crew, too? positive.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted. positive.
O'Neil? negative.
Last time I didn't. negative.
I can't go out.  Not like this. negative.
Do you, uh, know... positive.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special. positive.
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations. negative.
What're you guys doing?  Huh? negative.
She part of the training? negative.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft. negative.
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women -- negative.
We're fucked. negative.
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here. negative.
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way? negative.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks... negative.
Who the hell are all these people? negative.
What? negative.
Me!? You where the one... negative.
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you? positive.
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me. negative.
Yeah. Why are you asking? negative.
Animal, I can't. negative.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am. negative.
And you think this creature is one of them? positive.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing? negative.
Circuits are overloaded. negative.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system. positive.
Are you okay? negative.
You'd be surprised. negative.
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag? negative.
Mr. Caiman... negative.
I can't. negative.
You don't understand, I can get us information... negative.
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it? negative.
Hence the radiation. negative.
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone. negative.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means? negative.
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint. negative.
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population. negative.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system. negative.
Are you looking for this? positive.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest. negative.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country? negative.
What's with the chewing gum? positive.
What'd they say? positive.
Hello? negative.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only- negative.
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density. negative.
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone? negative.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine. negative.
You WILL go out there. negative.
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty... negative.
God, what an ass. negative.
At ease men. positive.
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav? negative.
What the hell is going on?!!? negative.
We heard it the first time! negative.
I don't know. positive.
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals." positive.
Hi Brandon. negative.
Oh.  Okay. negative.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels. positive.
Yes but, we were wondering- negative.
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent... positive.
What does the Omega 13 do? negative.
Go. They're off again. negative.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power? negative.
Systems register functional. negative.
No, I'll kill you. . positive.
...The digital conveyor. negative.
It's suicide. negative.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know. negative.
I am SO SICK of being right. negative.
Your last name. negative.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me. negative.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre? negative.
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you? positive.
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?... negative.
It's Jason... negative.
But I'm the Commander! negative.
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly. negative.
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard? negative.
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter. positive.
Thank God. Are you okay? negative.
What?  What did he say? negative.
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard? negative.
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor? negative.
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch! negative.
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half! negative.
You gotta admit, they do love him. positive.
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back. positive.
I heard it too. negative.
Yes. negative.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me! positive.
We pretend... negative.
We.. We lie. negative.
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine. negative.
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform? negative.
Theramin. negative.
Weapons storage... negative.
Oh, right, sorry. negative.
Okay... On what? negative.
Let's do it, Tommy. negative.
Continue forward, sir? negative.
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property. negative.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening? negative.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did. positive.
Go on... I want to hear everything. negative.
Is that a fact. negative.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want. positive.
Well, George, who were you? negative.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food. negative.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter. negative.
Misunderstood what!? negative.
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought. positive.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand? negative.
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth... positive.
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather? positive.
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us. negative.
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack. positive.
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath. positive.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on. negative.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating. positive.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor. negative.
What is this? negative.
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it? negative.
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation. positive.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts. negative.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment. negative.
Let's not over do it... negative.
Oh, come now... negative.
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington. negative.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army? positive.
General Lee is detained captain... negative.
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them. negative.
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable. negative.
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. negative.
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians... negative.
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible! negative.
And, Hamilton?  Greene? negative.
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad. negative.
Surely you knew this was coming. positive.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend. positive.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize. negative.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days... negative.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it! negative.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired. negative.
We can't take them.  Are you all right? negative.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours! positive.
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each! positive.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman. positive.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!? negative.
Then why are you teaching me...? negative.
Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped. negative.
You're out of your mind! negative.
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong." negative.
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives! negative.
I say! positive.
The land here is best for grain and corn. positive.
My daughter, I ask only... negative.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big. negative.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings? negative.
Trade for what? negative.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him. negative.
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that? negative.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in? positive.
About sixty. negative.
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand? negative.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money. negative.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him. positive.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that? positive.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep. positive.
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy". positive.
You know how to write one of these? positive.
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is. negative.
Karen? You okay? negative.
Where's Karen? negative.
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy". negative.
You positive about that? negative.
I'm working on a few things. negative.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it. negative.
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest. negative.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him? negative.
How'd you get in here? negative.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones? negative.
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came. negative.
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner. negative.
What're you doing in Los Angeles? negative.
Your wife a Lakers fan? negative.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do. negative.
That's what I'm doing. negative.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores. positive.
That's it? That's your movie? negative.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy. positive.
Part of it, yeah. positive.
What does that mean? negative.
For a movie? negative.
She looks familiar. negative.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script. positive.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there? negative.
Really. negative.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble. negative.
Yeah. That was a good party. positive.
So you don't know what I'm thinking. negative.
One we're producing. negative.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do? positive.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it. negative.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing. positive.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting. negative.
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake? positive.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp. negative.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked. negative.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand? negative.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night. negative.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read. positive.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you. positive.
Then you've read it? negative.
Why does anyone want to be in movies? negative.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset... negative.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it. negative.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty. negative.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it. positive.
You okay? negative.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time. positive.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star? negative.
Hm? negative.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.' positive.
Hello, Doris. negative.
What a spectacular view. negative.
I don't have a dog. positive.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it. negative.
How did you get in the house? negative.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys? positive.
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they? positive.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away? negative.
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too. negative.
A passenger liner, north island. Over. negative.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time.

The turbine blew. negative.
Roger. negative.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot. negative.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there? negative.
Did you? negative.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size. negative.
What's this? negative.
I know I know, two ways to do anything -- positive.
Went aboard. negative.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running. negative.

What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go? negative.
Damn barbaric is what it is. negative.
Can't you use something else? negative.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast. positive.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal. positive.
What?! negative.
That's a good thing? positive.
Coffee. negative.
Any dizziness? negative.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share. negative.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try. negative.
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste? negative.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard. positive.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured. positive.
Are you sure? negative.
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him. positive.
You just shoot at something? positive.
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio. positive.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold? negative.
Smashed it up pretty bad. negative.
The same day she supposedly went down. negative.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made." negative.
Hey. negative.
The what? negative.
What, like some kind of ghost? negative.
What do we do with him? positive.
They went crazy. negative.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way. positive.
I must be in the wrong business. negative.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight. negative.
Yeah. positive.
It's funny. negative.
Murphy, goddamit. negative.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it. positive.
I don't know. positive.
I say we off-load some of that gold now. negative.
Pretty low all around. positive.
How're you feeling? negative.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around. positive.
He took the shotgun and a light. negative.
Can't find the shotgun. negative.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here. negative.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place? negative.
Maxine. negative.
Yup. negative.
What? negative.
What are you trying to say? negative.
Who is this, Enid? negative.
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism? positive.
And how does an image like this help us to see that? positive.
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff? positive.
I... negative.
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you. negative.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall! negative.
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing? negative.
It's not optional! negative.
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun! negative.
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out. negative.
Yeah, well -- negative.
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this... positive.
Oh, hi... negative.
Why not? negative.
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class! negative.
Since when is she an "actress"? negative.
Did you sign up yet? negative.
Much later. positive.
I might actually get the pasta special. negative.
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us. negative.
Hey! We forgot to call the loser! negative.
You know, the green cardigan guy. positive.
You're better at it. negative.
Is he wearing a green cardigan? negative.
What's going on now? What's he doing? negative.
How about this one? negative.
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick. negative.
It's a surprise. negative.
I totally, totally hate you. positive.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining... positive.
But those are our people... positive.
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time. negative.
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment. positive.
You're just jealous. negative.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation? negative.
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?! negative.
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff. positive.
Do you want to do something tonight? positive.
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do... negative.
Look, we have to get these... negative.
Don't you want nice stuff? negative.
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job. negative.
Just some people from work... positive.
What? When did you see Josh?! negative.
When was this? negative.
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it? negative.
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break. negative.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death! negative.
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button. positive.
Didn't they tell you? negative.
Punk rock is over! negative.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money... negative.
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music. positive.
Is this one any good? negative.
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like -- negative.
Wow! negative.
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks? negative.
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records! negative.
Oh, come on! What are you talking about? negative.
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour. negative.
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds... negative.
I'm totally serious! negative.
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits? negative.
Wow! Look at all these creeps! positive.
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from. positive.
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No... positive.
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all. negative.
It's not hopeless... negative.
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else... positive.
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"! negative.
For nineteen years... negative.
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away. negative.
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation... negative.
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out. negative.
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk... negative.
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and -- negative.
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you... positive.
What are you doing here? negative.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty! positive.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity. negative.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you? negative.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be? positive.
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno... negative.
No... forget it... negative.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this? positive.
Let me see the sick. positive.
No hints, Samuel. negative.
Starting now, we attack them. negative.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm? positive.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you. negative.
Pleasant journey? negative.
Lovely sound- they seem happy. negative.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble- negative.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him. negative.
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it? positive.
That's a terrible idea- negative.
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that? negative.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing- negative.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts. negative.
All right- thee second embankment will go there. negative.
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks. positive.
What a good week. negative.
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once. negative.
How many do you think they've killed? positive.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came. negative.
What are they looking at? positive.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night. negative.
Thank you.  Why does he need you by him? negative.
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there. negative.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you. positive.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend? negative.
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it. negative.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it. positive.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this. positive.
Oh no. negative.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind. negative.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags? positive.
You're also a human being, Frank. negative.
No, you didn't, Frank. positive.
Hello, Peter. negative.
His name is Oscar. negative.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art. negative.
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised. negative.
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things. negative.
Are you all squeaky clean now? negative.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century. negative.
That's not true.  It was 1620. negative.
Is this the spot? positive.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016. negative.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world. positive.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter. negative.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately? negative.
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve. positive.
I can't believe a person could actually live like this. positive.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch. positive.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me? negative.
Should we go? negative.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia -- negative.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case? negative.
Can I have some of your water? negative.
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you. negative.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters. negative.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe. negative.
I'd like to have a stool specimen positive.
What now, Brainiac? negative.
That's it?  "I'll be back?" positive.
From where -- Neptune? negative.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy." negative.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us -- positive.
Is the line sinking? negative.
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi. positive.
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one. negative.
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are. negative.
What kind of tests? negative.
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here. positive.
What happened? negative.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you? positive.
Ready? negative.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise. negative.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out. negative.
She's moving! negative.
... I thought it was the drug store. negative.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me? negative.
Oh, Dana, it's you. negative.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party. negative.
Are you the Gatekeeper? negative.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you? negative.
You really don't act like a scientist. negative.
You're quite a housekeeper. negative.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy. positive.
I think I should spend the night here. positive.
I want to help you. negative.
What's he doing in my refrigerator. negative.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened? negative.
He is the Destructor. negative.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation. positive.
Oh, that's very - unusual. negative.
In the physical sense. negative.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin. positive.
Can I help you? negative.
Great!  How's it going? negative.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises? positive.
Circle? negative.
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one? positive.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove? negative.
Oh!  You're here. negative.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost? negative.
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon? positive.
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you. negative.
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point. positive.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world. negative.
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us! positive.
It's working! positive.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour? negative.
I don't know.  Talk to it. positive.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod. positive.
You'll never regret this, Ray. positive.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days. negative.
But most people are afraid to even report these things. positive.
Wow!  Does this pole still work? positive.
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it? positive.
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence. negative.
How was your date? negative.
Ray -- Something's here. positive.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me. negative.
How do you know? positive.
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any. negative.
Agile bastard, isn't he? negative.
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there? negative.
What's he talking about?  Choose what? negative.
They hate me, they really hate me don't they? positive.
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him. negative.
For the gods, spit it out! negative.
What is that... wailing? negative.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever. negative.
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action... negative.
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience? positive.
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you. negative.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on? negative.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius. positive.
Take grain away from the army? negative.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime. negative.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case... negative.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know. positive.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator. negative.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he? positive.
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line! positive.
You cannot die. negative.
I made the plume from a quail feather. negative.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can. positive.
Serious stuff... negative.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators... negative.
What about their philosophy lessons? negative.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us! positive.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned? positive.
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly? negative.
Death is a very light thing for you. negative.
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise. negative.
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life! positive.
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer! negative.
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money? negative.
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet. positive.
How much money is involved? positive.
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome. negative.
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us. positive.
Do you know what you're going to do? positive.
Why not? negative.
Will you take me home now? negative.
I think I'd better go home now please. negative.
Do you? negative.
Was she married or something? positive.
With a family? positive.
All right. negative.
Is that him over there? negative.
Yes. negative.
What? negative.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley? negative.
Is it because I'm here? negative.
I said I think it is. positive.
Well, I want you to leave. positive.
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my... positive.
Why? negative.
Can I just sit here while you're packing? negative.
What are you looking for? negative.
Don't you have it on? positive.
Are you going home? negative.
Why wouldn't it? negative.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much? negative.
Why do you have to see him? negative.
Oh no. He said that. negative.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment -- negative.
Are you listening? negative.
You're not one of those agitators? negative.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery. negative.
Where are you? negative.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it? negative.
Is there an ashtray in here? positive.
Whatever it is you're upset about. negative.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something. positive.
Thank you. negative.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house. negative.
What do you drink? Bourbon? negative.
All right then. negative.
Please wait till my husband gets home. negative.
Drink? negative.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion. negative.
Did you know that? positive.
Oh my God. negative.
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that. positive.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you. negative.
What is wrong with me? positive.
Thank you. negative.
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't -- negative.
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement. negative.
Yes, I do. positive.
Did you get us a room? negative.
Do you want to? negative.
Yes. negative.
Yes? negative.
To tell you? positive.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512. negative.
Yes? negative.
You what? negative.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable? positive.
Are you afraid of me? negative.
Benjamin, is this your first time? positive.
It's nothing to be ashamed of -- negative.
Anything. Anything at all. negative.
Oh my God. negative.
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic. positive.
Oh. negative.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art. positive.
Do you want to hear it or not? negative.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel. negative.
There isn't any. positive.
Always? positive.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room. negative.
You have not slept with your husband for five years? negative.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you -- negative.
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him. negative.
Well I can't. negative.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who... negative.
At college. positive.
Well how did it happen? negative.
Really. I want to know. negative.
Good. negative.
No. negative.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I? positive.
I don't believe you. negative.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it. negative.
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her. positive.
I'm afraid I don't understand. negative.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin. positive.
Can I talk to you a minute? negative.
Well why do you -- why do you think that? positive.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me. negative.
When did you two talk this over? negative.
Well -- negative.
What? negative.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners? positive.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man. negative.
Hello. negative.
Now look -- please -- negative.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands. negative.
HUH? negative.
Hello. negative.
Can you see me now? negative.
They came all the way from Tarzana. negative.
Need any help? positive.
How? negative.
No -- no -- no -- no... negative.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you. negative.
Like dancing? positive.
You? negative.
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but -- negative.
Yes? -- Tomorrow? negative.
That was lovely. negative.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday. positive.
But surely you must know -- because I love you. positive.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go? positive.
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature. negative.
Strange man... negative.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer -- negative.
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand. negative.
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you. negative.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you? negative.
Really? negative.
No? negative.
I'll not denounce you. negative.
Do you understand? negative.
You do believe that I really love you? negative.
I want to be good to you -- madly good. negative.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now... negative.
Then you know him? positive.
Hello -- sorry I'm late. negative.
The Baron is tired? negative.
If we could scare up some men to play. negative.
That was my last. positive.
I take five hundred. negative.
Goodnight, Kringelein. negative.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night? negative.
For me? negative.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once -- positive.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill... negative.
Oh, I've got to find it. positive.
A man might what? negative.
You're trembling. negative.
What's the matter? negative.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was. negative.
Then why did you have anything to do with him? negative.
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me? negative.
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel. positive.
Moreover -- negative.
You're a very unusual stenographer -- negative.
What is this? negative.
You... negative.
No. negative.
Not too quickly. negative.
How nice -- your daughters? negative.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm. positive.
Tomorrow morning. negative.
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. positive.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean -- positive.
What we want to know about is Manchester. positive.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester? negative.
I mean with the Manchester people? positive.
All right. negative.
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon! negative.
I know you did -- I said you did -- positive.
If you actually have news from Manchester then... negative.
I can't dance tonight -- negative.
Good morning, Suzette. positive.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train. negative.
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight. negative.
Take them back, Suzette. negative.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo -- negative.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath. negative.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk. negative.
What is this insolence? negative.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron. positive.
If you will wait one moment, sir. negative.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir. positive.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine. positive.
No. No word. negative.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway. positive.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time. negative.
Your what? negative.
You want a drink? negative.
He's a good kid. A salesman. negative.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly? negative.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh... negative.
You ruined me! You destroyed me! negative.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation. positive.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon! negative.
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it? negative.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing? negative.
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that. positive.
Not much time. negative.
Here you are! Two rich people! negative.
Yes, yes, but that's -- negative.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar. negative.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all? negative.
All right. negative.
Whadaya say? positive.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen? negative.
What? Me? negative.
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy? negative.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at -- positive.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy. negative.
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what? negative.
Up to you. negative.
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that! negative.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you. positive.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego? negative.
If you come out to the track, don't know me. negative.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore. negative.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know. negative.
Going somewhere? negative.
Myra followed you, huh? negative.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it. positive.
Just a few bucks. positive.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo -- positive.
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this. positive.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side. positive.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes... negative.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more -- negative.
Where's the five? negative.
Look at me. negative.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work. positive.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark. positive.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker! negative.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year. negative.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me. negative.
Yeah? positive.
You were gone for a while. negative.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners? negative.
I don't think I need it. positive.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners. positive.
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever. positive.
What is it? What's going on? negative.
What's that? negative.
Roy Dillon? negative.
I realize this is a shock. positive.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even. negative.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon. negative.
That's that, then. negative.
Mr. Simms. negative.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers. negative.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell. negative.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that? negative.
Where? negative.
You take all your dates here. Blake? negative.
Carter. negative.
Funny, we just drove right in. negative.
A dead body? negative.
Think Eddie had something to do with it? positive.
No shit?! negative.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets... negative.
What the -- negative.
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms? positive.
I promise not to run off to Cancun. negative.
Oh, so now it's my fault? negative.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom? positive.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught. positive.
You look kind of cold. negative.
Better? negative.
Still wants to move out? negative.
This kid just wants his freedom. positive.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free. positive.
What are you looking at? positive.
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode. positive.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will. negative.
Keri, you all right? negative.
Wait. negative.
Ooooh, busted. negative.
Thanks! negative.
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria. negative.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother? negative.
Is Tim there? negative.
Guess they -- went to the fair after all. negative.
What if your parents come home? negative.
Aren't you gonna answer that? negative.
Mommy, I'm scared. negative.
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me. negative.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming? negative.
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for? positive.
God, what's wrong with him? positive.
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic. negative.
What now?! negative.
Come on! negative.
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink. negative.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over. positive.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well. positive.
Where's the child? negative.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell. negative.
Yes? negative.
I'm sorry, but do I know you -- negative.
What do you know about Michael? positive.
Miss me, baby? negative.
A bitch. negative.
Home, sweet home. positive.
Home. positive.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy. positive.
You know what gets me about that Cadillac? negative.
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy! positive.
Could have happened to anybody. positive.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats. negative.
Go to the funeral? negative.
All the more reason to go to Africa. negative.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know? positive.
I know you think that. positive.
I don't think so.  It could have been. positive.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live." negative.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die? negative.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup? negative.
Gee whiz-- negative.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out. negative.
You were about to ask a question? negative.
No. negative.
What does he do--of an athletic nature? negative.
Oh hell. negative.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more. negative.
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia. negative.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports? negative.
You're a very good boy to respond that way. negative.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may. negative.
A hundred dollars! negative.
Can I get dressed first? negative.
"Hamburger Heaven." negative.
This is crazy. positive.
Your old beau? negative.
When I'm dead--  or fucking. negative.
He hasn't had breakfast yet. negative.
You used to like it stark! positive.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had. negative.
The doctor. negative.
Why not? negative.
I came for my clothes. negative.
You took him to the funeral, I hear. negative.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you. positive.
Honor, I suppose. negative.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all. positive.
Help your mother find the bullet. negative.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now? negative.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows? positive.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen? negative.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy! negative.
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes. negative.
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back. positive.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope. negative.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee. negative.
I feel the same way.  What next? positive.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps? negative.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure. negative.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it. positive.
I thought she was a widow. negative.
There's a certain amount of information there. positive.
What brought you back? negative.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct? negative.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are. positive.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that? negative.
I love you!  Have a cigar! negative.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze? negative.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that? negative.
You hope. negative.
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown." negative.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect. negative.
Was I ever of use? negative.
Like the saber-toothed tiger. positive.
No. negative.
I dunno, boy. negative.
You didn't even find that out? positive.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum. negative.
Alice is dead? negative.
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know. negative.
Won't you please join our club? Please? negative.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right? negative.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right? negative.
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way. negative.
That goes double for me. negative.
Oh, Paul-- negative.
Where will you be? negative.
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged? negative.
Yes, he is. negative.
What are his symptoms? negative.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope. negative.
We don't have a maid any more. negative.
I hate that thing. positive.
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet. negative.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long. negative.
What then? negative.
Did you see him? negative.
Is he coming home? negative.
The park! negative.
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake. negative.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed. positive.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much. positive.
This is very good for us. positive.
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty. negative.
They didn't murder me. negative.
Thank you.  Thank you very much. positive.
Minors aren't allowed at fights. positive.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time. negative.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we? negative.
No, just not the type. negative.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities. negative.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you? negative.
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone. negative.
Hello. You want some information? negative.
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Up front? negative.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week. negative.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something? negative.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you? negative.
Of Joanne's? negative.
Jesus. negative.
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you. negative.
Say what? negative.
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you? negative.
What's T-J? negative.
Yeah, yeah, go on. positive.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer. positive.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life. positive.
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around... negative.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them. negative.
You are. negative.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper. positive.
Hello? negative.
Where is she? negative.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist. positive.
Why don't you tell me something for a change? negative.
What happened, pilgrim? negative.
Is Marsha there? negative.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me. positive.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing. positive.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me. negative.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other. positive.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere? positive.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony... negative.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store? negative.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents? negative.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest. positive.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything. positive.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law. negative.
You are at the University, Candy? positive.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please? negative.
Come again. negative.
Isn't this your vehicle? positive.
We planted it. negative.
Check. negative.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold? positive.
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this? positive.
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact. positive.
And what do you do, my dear? positive.
Sorry I'm late. negative.
What do you see? negative.
Here's your shovel. negative.
Eh, no. Thank you. negative.
I don't know. positive.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold? negative.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it. positive.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd? negative.
Sort of. negative.
Harold? negative.
Do you often model for Glaucus? negative.
Me! No. Of course not. negative.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell? negative.
It goes on and on. negative.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie. negative.
Why do you say that? negative.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that. negative.
What happened? negative.
Okay? negative.
I <u>think</u> I see it. positive.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat? negative.
You are the wisest person I know. negative.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room. positive.
Maude, do you pray? negative.
Want to join me in some cartwheels? negative.
From the guys who got the matches, of course. negative.
Oh. negative.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided. negative.
Oh, you weren't scared. negative.
You should have been a poet. negative.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same. negative.
Farewell? negative.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so. negative.
I'm getting married. negative.
Would you like a cigarette? positive.
Do you play? negative.
Fifteen. negative.
No. negative.
Harold? negative.
Would you care to talk about this friend? positive.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold? positive.
You liked your teachers? negative.
Your studies? negative.
Then why did you leave? negative.
What would you say? negative.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness. negative.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of. negative.
It's the greatest excitement in the world. positive.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands. negative.
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own. positive.
Stay where you are, Harold . negative.
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it. negative.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame. negative.
You knew? negative.
Yes... Yes. You look... negative.
It's coming. negative.
I... I had a visitor. negative.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got... positive.
I've got to finish it. positive.
Well... G'bye. negative.
But I didn't open it! I didn't! negative.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank? positive.
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now. negative.
The past, the future, whatever this object holds. positive.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out -- positive.
You were burned by some organic acid. negative.
Red. How long was it latched onto you? negative.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs. negative.
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that. negative.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal -- negative.
If he's here, this is worse than I thought. negative.
What the hell was that? An ape? negative.
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor. negative.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know? positive.
It's her choice --  She's human -- positive.
How does he know so much about me? positive.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir? negative.
On the desk, yes. In Latin. negative.
Got tired of me? positive.
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what? negative.
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key. negative.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless. positive.
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I? negative.
Yup. negative.
Thank you. negative.
You're kidding -- negative.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you. negative.
Whatcha looking at, John?? positive.
What took you so long? negative.
Where do you -- negative.
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" -- negative.
Nah, sounds too "needy." positive.
Hey, your chili's getting cold -- negative.
You better have that looked at. positive.
Out? Out out? negative.
You're going alone? negative.
Hi. negative.
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name -- negative.
Strong. negative.
But it's not true, is it? negative.
That you feel that way about me. negative.
Hello, I'm -- negative.
Pardon? negative.
Lucky man. negative.
The box... you opened it. We came. negative.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration. positive.
Let me alone, will you? negative.
Come to Daddy. negative.
Bastard. negative.
You're Julia, right? negative.
Well can I come in or not? negative.
Well? negative.
Wedded bliss? negative.
No. God no. positive.
...somebody... negative.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking. negative.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you. negative.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors. negative.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which. negative.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth. positive.
She'll tell them everything... positive.
Well we can't just stay here -- positive.
Kirsty? It's very late. negative.
What's the problem? negative.
No, damn you -- positive.
It's ONE of these. negative.
How long since you were here? positive.
Why didn't he want to sell it? negative.
How are you doing through there? negative.
Is it deep? negative.
You're NOT going to faint. negative.
Maybe a brandy. positive.
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe? positive.
What's wrong? negative.
Not much fun, is it? positive.
No, not much. positive.
What's going on? negative.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm. negative.
You know, you're very beautiful. positive.
Who brought me in here? negative.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually. negative.
You'd like the house. positive.
It's like she's waiting for something. negative.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends. positive.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now. positive.
I'm here. negative.
You know I do know the way home. positive.
I've been better. negative.
Are you busy after work ? positive.
These THINGS... they want to take me -- positive.
What? negative.
Alison's. negative.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care. negative.
Don't you want to hear what's next? negative.
What did you tell her about the shop for? negative.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us. negative.
What? negative.
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash. negative.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it? negative.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now? negative.
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock. negative.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha! negative.
It was Jan, and it was a long time after-- negative.
Because it's in The Big Chill. negative.
Sonic Death Monkey. negative.
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album -- negative.
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers? positive.
A couple blocks!  About six! negative.
Anna. negative.
What are you talking about? negative.
Is there a difference? negative.
Sure, but is that it for the list? negative.
Hey Charlie. negative.
Great. positive.
Let's not. negative.
Rob --! negative.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's -- negative.
What is this. negative.
Laura?  Are you okay? negative.
I'm upset, but I'm fine. negative.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now. negative.
Yeah. positive.
I dunno. negative.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough. negative.
Shit! negative.
Hi. negative.
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection." negative.
So you weren't interested in music at all? negative.
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything. negative.
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week? negative.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing. negative.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here. positive.
I suppose so. negative.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help. positive.
Yeah.  Great. positive.
No problem.  If I can ask one question. negative.
You won't like it. negative.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better? negative.
I don't know. positive.
Never? negative.
Hi. negative.
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much. negative.
Are you still in love with me? positive.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever -- positive.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you. positive.
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them. negative.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so. negative.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it. negative.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do. positive.
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night? negative.
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus. positive.
What do you want to do? positive.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here. positive.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill? negative.
What about Ian? negative.
You know the difference. positive.
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better. negative.
But what? negative.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs. negative.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so. positive.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I. negative.
Just local, of course. positive.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled? negative.
Are you worried about tomorrow night? negative.
What are you going to talk to me about? negative.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet. positive.
No.  Probably not. negative.
Very persuasive. negative.
So? negative.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes? negative.
What's the -- hey, Liz -- negative.
Enough, Liz. negative.
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know? positive.
So you live in Chicago now? negative.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff? negative.
The Conformist. negative.
I'll call you. negative.
What do you think? positive.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that. negative.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now? negative.
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys. negative.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair. positive.
Huh? negative.
Would you like more tea? positive.
Grave robbers? negative.
He called you "MacLeod". negative.
What about me? negative.
No. negative.
When you finish, what then? negative.
Maybe it would do us both good. positive.
I hope I never get that old. negative.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you. negative.
I'm not even sure why. negative.
Who are you? negative.
Yes. negative.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work. positive.
I didn't kill the watchman. negative.
Don't. negative.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about. negative.
What is it? negative.
Get out. negative.
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed? negative.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him. negative.
Good way to lose your job. negative.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did. negative.
Who is it? negative.
I don't believe him. positive.
-Et lux perpetua- negative.
Aye. negative.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle? negative.
Aye. negative.
I was driven out. negative.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth. negative.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you? negative.
I don't understand. negative.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed. negative.
But we cannot be killed. negative.
Harder.  Concentrate harder. negative.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more. negative.
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company. negative.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands. negative.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it? negative.
Romirez understood.  Not you. negative.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last. negative.
Your name? negative.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill. negative.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke. negative.
My father taught me. negative.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually. positive.
_Answer_ me. negative.
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night? negative.
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence. positive.
And have you something to settle with me? positive.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope. negative.
I knew his great-grandfather. negative.
Long time. positive.
Run! negative.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing. positive.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it! negative.
Tradition. negative.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you? positive.
You're a kind man to be sure. negative.
You're one of William's kids, huh? negative.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike. negative.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing. positive.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging? negative.
What doing? negative.
Who is it? negative.
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here. negative.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope. negative.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow. positive.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm. negative.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied? negative.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been. negative.
BRUCE!! How'd you get out? negative.
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours. negative.
Hildy! Where's mother? negative.
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you? negative.
Mother? But your mother -- negative.
How's business, Bruce? negative.
I'm beginning to realize that. negative.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything. negative.
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you. negative.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this? positive.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this. negative.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory! negative.
Call Duffy! negative.
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag. negative.
What's this? negative.
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me. negative.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for. negative.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker. positive.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again. negative.
I haven't any hard feelings. positive.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg -- negative.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything. negative.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you! negative.
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day. negative.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more! negative.
Bermuda. negative.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it? negative.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good. negative.
Afraid? I should say not! negative.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you. negative.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom. negative.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town. positive.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic! negative.
What do you mean? negative.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition. negative.
Now you're talking! negative.
What do you think I am -- a crook? positive.
Where do you think you're going? positive.
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it! negative.
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late! negative.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you? negative.
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now! negative.
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through? negative.
Ring that number, will you? negative.
Don't open that! negative.
How was that for a tight squeeze? negative.
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy! negative.
Anything you want, Boss. negative.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us! negative.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here? positive.
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars? positive.
There's money in it, Cooley. negative.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization. negative.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though. negative.
She says she's gonna write fiction. negative.
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it. positive.
So have we! negative.
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something? positive.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree. positive.
Goodbye, Yonson. negative.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say. positive.
Just a minute, Johnson! positive.
Take your paws off me! negative.
He's harmless. negative.
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane! positive.
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference. negative.
Just one second -- positive.
Pete, I want to talk to you! negative.
Did you actually give Williams that gun? negative.
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies. positive.
Pure politics! negative.
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you. positive.
Shoot to kill, I said. negative.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you. positive.
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that! positive.
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary. negative.
I won't. negative.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued. negative.
Let him out of here, Lieutenant. negative.
You'll take fifty and like it! positive.
Where's the old lady? negative.
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better. negative.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more. negative.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman? negative.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it? positive.
Okay.  Forget it. negative.
Look out, you -- negative.
Kings and sixes. negative.
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing. positive.
Mother! negative.
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs. negative.
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things. positive.
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course. negative.
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person. positive.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use". negative.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either. negative.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet! negative.
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back. negative.
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe. negative.
Are you all right, now? negative.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife -- negative.
Look out! negative.
Get the cops, somebody. negative.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered -- negative.
Baldwin -- his name is. negative.
The door was locked. negative.
Can I try? negative.
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity? negative.
Give him the you-know-what. negative.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen? positive.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites. negative.
Bloody. negative.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way. negative.
Go and ask her if she wants to play. positive.
Tell them about Pauline's mum. negative.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam. negative.
Can't we just see the end? positive.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face. negative.
Wow! negative.
It was great for me, how was it for you. negative.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing? negative.
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but.... positive.
What is it? negative.
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs. positive.
We don't know anything about it positive.
Well? negative.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it? negative.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him. negative.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life. negative.
I don't believe this is happening to me. negative.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back. positive.
Molly! negative.
You're having me on, Molly. negative.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy. negative.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again. negative.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years. negative.
Cone. negative.
I agree. negative.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here. positive.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me. negative.
Thank you. negative.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals. negative.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up. positive.
No, really. negative.
But suppose for a second you did. negative.
No, no I think it's really interesting. positive.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man. negative.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about. negative.
Keep straight on this road here. positive.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet? negative.
She looks like she stinks. positive.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken. negative.
Almost there. negative.
I like sleep. negative.
What's he so excited about? negative.
Should we stop? negative.
Hey, he moved. negative.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable. negative.
How much is a person supposed to stand? positive.
What are you doing! negative.
Come on, get with the facts. negative.
Is that all... think real hard. positive.
How's about you give me those same directions. negative.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb. negative.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils. negative.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass. negative.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all. negative.
Fuck, it's freezing. negative.
What are you laughing at? negative.
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down? negative.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer. negative.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa? negative.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal. positive.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it. negative.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl. negative.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked. positive.
I think I'm going fucking crazy. negative.
What was that? negative.
Jesus Christ. negative.
What'd we here, Georgie? negative.
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing. positive.
Recover any bodies? negative.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone. positive.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen. positive.
This is way too fucked up for words. negative.
Where's Bill? negative.
Grampa... watch the language. positive.
Turn up this road. negative.
We gotta break it open. negative.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down. positive.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan. negative.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with. positive.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy. positive.
And? negative.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date. negative.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help. negative.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet? positive.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle? negative.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we? positive.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant. negative.
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no? negative.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son? negative.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl. negative.
What is wrong, my darling? negative.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila. negative.
My little French. positive.
I love you so much, Gabrielle. positive.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too. negative.
Well? negative.
Anyway. Come already to the point. negative.
You were wonderful! negative.
I want our boy back. negative.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back. positive.
My apologies, madam. negative.
Very well. positive.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it. negative.
You what? negative.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail. positive.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever. negative.
Yeah? positive.
Oh? negative.
Yeah. My brother told me. positive.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob? negative.
Go the fuck away, Rosie. positive.
How'd you know where I was? negative.
I'm going to miss you. negative.
As do I. negative.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true. positive.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond. negative.
It looks wonderful. negative.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish... negative.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas. negative.
You do? negative.
What are you doing in there? negative.
Do you? Oh do you, darling? positive.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit? positive.
Flares? negative.
Did you see that? negative.
I don't know. Something. positive.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality. negative.
Who from work? positive.
It would just be helpful to know. positive.
Really? negative.
That's great. It's a great color for you. positive.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in... negative.
Bravo to you, Puff! negative.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight. negative.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy! negative.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do. negative.
Puff, put the gun down. negative.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we? negative.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again. positive.
Mother? negative.
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever. negative.
Boys just passing through? positive.
Pittsburgh? negative.
Comin' in or goin' out? negative.
Huh? negative.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard? negative.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon? negative.
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech. negative.
I want to talk to you. negative.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie. negative.
We'll be there. positive.
How much? positive.
Do you really think you can beat him? negative.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist. positive.
Make it twenty. negative.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. negative.
Poker's not your game. negative.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink? positive.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers. negative.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent. positive.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive. negative.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays. negative.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs. negative.
You must have a lot of confidence in me. negative.
Sure. negative.
How do we stand? negative.
When do I raise the bet? negative.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute! negative.
I wanna walk. negative.
I got time, Bert. negative.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY! negative.
Fifty per cent? negative.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert? negative.
Boy, we really gave it to her good. negative.
You name it, we shoot it. negative.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom? negative.
You got that wrong, mister. I am. negative.
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does. negative.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck! negative.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table. negative.
Quit. He's too good. negative.
Hey, how much are we ahead? positive.
You don't need a drink. positive.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself? negative.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me? negative.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody. positive.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating? negative.
HOW MUCH?! positive.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money. positive.
Yeah, to play Fats again. positive.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie? positive.
You gentlemen care for a drink? negative.
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson? positive.
You quittin' too? negative.
You quittin', friend? positive.
How long you been waiting? negative.
Yours. negative.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker? positive.
You don't look like a college girl. positive.
Hey! negative.
I could always get us a bottle. positive.
A day like any other. People come, people go. positive.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out? negative.
Eddie, where do you go when you go out? negative.
You going out? negative.
Give it back to me. negative.
He knows. A lot. positive.
Well, he owns things. positive.
Well, what else does? negative.
You need the words? negative.
Sherry.  Very old, very dry. negative.
What do you want to tell me? negative.
Oh, grow up. negative.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games? negative.
That's what the game's all about. negative.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me. negative.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland. positive.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners -- negative.
When you're here, in the city, where do you live? positive.
I only protect myself -- ! negative.
I don't know. positive.
Humans. negative.
Shhh... don't talk. negative.
You and that damned garden. negative.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much. negative.
Bathroom? negative.
Is the hill ours too? negative.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill. negative.
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow. positive.
We were having a little talk. negative.
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends? negative.
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch? negative.
Where, Jimmy? negative.
No. negative.
They'll get us. positive.
Did you call the State Police? negative.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed. positive.
George, where have you been? negative.
Your father asked you a question. negative.
When? negative.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down. negative.
You still believe in him. negative.
What the hell is this? negative.
There's good news and bad news. negative.
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely... negative.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening? positive.
Pops! negative.
You still got the Olds? negative.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything. positive.
Spunky? negative.
You punched the President in the face? negative.

So, what do you do for a living? negative.
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm. negative.
I don't need it. positive.
We're leaving, don't try and stop us. positive.
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got. negative.
Call them back. negative.
Why did you people come here? negative.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour. negative.
You know how long I've been looking for that?! positive.
Do you believe the Grail actually exists? negative.
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith. negative.
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly? negative.
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city. negative.
Marcus! negative.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever." negative.
An old man's dream. negative.
Fraulein -- will you permit me? negative.
It would make me very happy. negative.
What's that? negative.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this? positive.
This. positive.
At least I let you tag along. negative.
How did you get here? negative.
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika. negative.
It is you Junior! negative.
Oh, it breaks the heart. negative.
Dad, they come in through the doors. negative.
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it. positive.
Well, what was left of him. negative.
If only I could have been with you. negative.
Rats? negative.
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers. negative.
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi? negative.
I ought to tell you something. positive.
Dad! negative.
My Diary's in Berlin. negative.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge. negative.
Well... I can't think of anything. positive.
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize. negative.
I like Indiana. positive.
Ready? negative.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it. negative.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count? negative.
Why are you trying to kill us? negative.
Who are you? negative.
Interested in local curios? negative.
I believe we're being called to dinner. negative.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi -- negative.
What? negative.
Hard to believe, isn't it...? negative.
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible. positive.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken". negative.
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness. positive.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife? negative.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts. negative.
That was a misunderstanding. negative.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power. negative.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones. negative.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi? negative.
You have insulted my son. negative.
Now what about the antidote, Lao. negative.
I ride with you, Indy? positive.
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one. negative.
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones. negative.
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you... negative.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful! positive.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote! negative.
You don't look very good. negative.
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?! positive.
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing! negative.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water. negative.
A what...? negative.
Don't let it curl around you! negative.
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now. negative.
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva. positive.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers. positive.
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety. positive.
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave? negative.
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around! positive.
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory! negative.
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them! negative.
Figures... negative.
I said something. positive.
No, not her. Me. positive.
My name is AL. negative.
Where are you,...Al? negative.
Arrrgh! negative.
Who was it? negative.
You're in my head... negative.
Your name is Al... negative.
Somebody's been here. negative.
Yeah...Who? negative.
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that! negative.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head. negative.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain. negative.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head? negative.
Why he's argumentative? negative.
No they won't. negative.
Behind us? negative.
What'd he look like? negative.
I don't know...To get Al. positive.
JOE Or what? negative.
Yeah...Who is? negative.
What do you mean we. negative.
Black suits and helmets. negative.
I'm back. negative.
Who is it? negative.
What about money? negative.
I don't have any. positive.
It's illegal. negative.
It's just not enough. negative.
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what? negative.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like? positive.
She doesn't seem to understand. negative.
What? negative.
Wait. negative.
It worked. negative.
What did that cost? negative.
Follow that busboy. negative.
Joe, be careful! negative.
Voice stress analyzer. negative.
You're doing great with her. positive.
It's embarrassing. negative.
You shut down your sensors. negative.
What Happened? negative.
Osaka. negative.
Don't you think I stand out like this. positive.
On what? negative.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through. positive.
Don't touch a thing. positive.
What next! positive.
Ow! negative.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind. negative.
What was it? What'd I say? negative.
There's a lot you don't know. positive.
What happened? negative.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here. positive.
She works for them. positive.
You're a lucky man. negative.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out. positive.
What are you doing? negative.
You just got a Mickey. positive.
Not that truth! negative.
Sorry... negative.
Doesn't matter. negative.
What is your name? negative.
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study. positive.
Me. negative.
We'll have to let them go. negative.
That crazy guy? positive.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that. negative.
Enough ROmance. negative.
It is to me too. negative.
It may have been affected. negative.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright? negative.
You'll feel better negative.
Why would we want to hurt you? negative.
Who? negative.
Al? negative.
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head. negative.
Ahhh...nothing. negative.
Sue who? negative.
What do you want? negative.
Is someone else here? negative.
...Blake negative.
I'll be right there. positive.
And you. negative.
You mean from it. positive.
And you? negative.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction.. negative.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to? positive.
Your friends, did they ask about me? negative.
You work for Ryuji? negative.
Then why are you smiling like that? negative.
What's Gruner like? negative.
And Dieter. negative.
And you? negative.
Where we going? negative.
What? negative.
How? negative.
That must be him. Water taxi. negative.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him. positive.
Are you alright? negative.
What did you tell them? negative.
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you negative.
He can't help us. negative.
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this. negative.
It wasn't me. It was him. negative.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine. negative.
It's alright. negative.
Screw the PEM...What about Al... negative.
Hi, honey. negative.
Where? negative.
Three hours. negative.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie? negative.
Alright, alright. negative.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you... positive.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?! negative.
You're exaggerating! negative.
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk! negative.
What the hell are you doing? negative.
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview. negative.
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand? positive.
That computer has everything... positive.
I'm gonna do a follow-up. negative.
Mike... Mike... Mike... negative.
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?" positive.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview. negative.
Why? negative.
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything? positive.
Yeah. positive.
No classes this morning? negative.
What?! negative.
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it. negative.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures. negative.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way... negative.
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it. positive.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air? positive.
Yeah, that's right. positive.
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon. negative.
That Canada story? Still interest you? negative.
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media? negative.
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow. negative.
Look, I really don't have that much time... positive.
Should I just take the documents now? negative.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me? negative.
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...? positive.
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences! negative.
Seven dwarfs? negative.
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place? positive.
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it. positive.
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus? positive.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around! negative.
Excuse me. Yeah... positive.
Good. But Jeff... positive.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition... negative.
You attract a crowd. negative.
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company? negative.
ABC Telemarketing Company. negative.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life! positive.
You try and have a good time. positive.
Did he hear you? negative.
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay? negative.
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week... negative.
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore. negative.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen... negative.
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision. negative.
Hello. negative.
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you... negative.
Jail? negative.
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil... positive.
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you -- negative.
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing -- negative.
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve? negative.
So she's uh, flourishing? negative.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh? negative.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room. negative.
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment. negative.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey. negative.
You're in a rush. negative.
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot! negative.
What the hell is Botox? negative.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle. negative.
He's the wrong man. negative.
I'm happy for you, pal. negative.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup? negative.
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised. negative.
So who'd you hire? negative.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her. negative.
I begged you to have a baby! negative.
How nice. negative.
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down. negative.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that? positive.
What is it you're after, Miles? negative.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough. positive.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery. positive.
Screw you, asswipe! negative.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting. positive.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup -- negative.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe... positive.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless. negative.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you. negative.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience? negative.
You do? negative.
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage. negative.
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the... negative.
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage. positive.
Hi. negative.
Miles? You're scaring me. negative.
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind." positive.
I'm reporting you to the IRS. negative.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles -- negative.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us. positive.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle? negative.
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you. negative.
Are you alright? You lost weight. negative.
Do you need a Tagamet? positive.
Who's that? negative.
Wow. negative.
Do you know him? positive.
Who's she? negative.
You're not... negative.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed. positive.
But you're going through with it? negative.
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking. negative.
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it. negative.
That's delusional. negative.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate. negative.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth? negative.
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars... negative.
Mr. Rexroth. negative.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described? negative.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel? negative.
In anticipation of making you sick. negative.
And she has...? negative.
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle. negative.
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the... negative.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration? negative.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second. negative.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented. negative.
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh? positive.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in positive.
That's an evasion. negative.
You ought to know why. Because positive.
Because marrying that fool King Westley is negative.
Smart, aren't you! So subtle. negative.
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat. negative.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing. positive.
Please don't shout. negative.
Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to negative.
Oh, come now negative.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again. negative.
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward. negative.
Are you going to see him? negative.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat? negative.
What would you like to have me do? positive.

You thought that up all by yourself, huh? negative.

Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows. positive.
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions. negative.
Whadda you want! negative.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. negative.
I beg your pardon! negative.
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested. negative.
No. I'd rather you didn't. negative.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away? positive.
What for? negative.
I never thought of that. negative.
That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right. negative.
You've got a name, haven't you? positive.

Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs. negative.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun. negative.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. positive.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question. negative.
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you? positive.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8] negative.
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan. negative.
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe. negative.
I better go over and see her. negative.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus? negative.

If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick? negative.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast. negative.
You think it's simple, huh? positive.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two. negative.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13] negative.
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it. negative.
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love? negative.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited positive.
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart. negative.

What's up? negative.
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world. positive.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly. negative.

Got a couple of kids, huh? negative.
You love them, don't you? negative.

When did you first do business with this Bertrand? positive.
And Oswald? negative.

All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke. negative.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy. negative.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office negative.

What do you think, Lou? positive.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome." positive.
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger. negative.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source? negative.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand. negative.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying! negative.
Can you get some sworn statements? negative.
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country? negative.
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers. positive.

Aren't you being a little hard? positive.
I'm not sure I understand. negative.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.

After dinner you paid him to have sex with you. negative.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.

Hi. negative.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it. negative.

That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me. negative.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time. negative.
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do. negative.
The Office of Naval Intelligence. negative.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film. positive.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is? negative.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou. negative.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything. negative.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation. negative.
Pictures like this don't show up on television! negative.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions. negative.
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country? positive.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify? positive.
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it. negative.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time? positive.
And he never hit you before? negative.

Where were you?  Europe, Pacific? negative.
That's all you've had all this time? positive.
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning. negative.
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial? negative.
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it? negative.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform. negative.
What'd ya mean? negative.
That requires me goin' out tonight? negative.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you? positive.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places. positive.
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it. negative.
This is your money? positive.
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs? negative.
Help yourself. negative.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment? positive.
How was your flight? negative.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like? negative.

Hello. negative.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about? negative.

What are you talking about? negative.
Hey, wait! negative.
Daddy, what was that noise? negative.
It's cold. negative.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand. negative.

It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there. positive.

You're not going anywhere. negative.

I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland. negative.
She's right. negative.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic. negative.
Got a pen on you? negative.
What? What?! negative.
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him. negative.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around? negative.
What happened? negative.
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat? negative.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake! positive.
I hope we get some more help. negative.
And nobody else saw her in the water? positive.
Think she might've run out on you? positive.
You here for the summer? negative.
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat. negative.
We're not even sure what it was. negative.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police... negative.
Would you like something? Some coffee? negative.
You love sharks? negative.
Well... is everything all right? negative.
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs -- negative.
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there... positive.
20 feet, if it's an inch... negative.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last. negative.
What can that gun of yours do? negative.
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater! positive.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy. negative.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick. positive.
Go Carole.  So, guess what? negative.
Whose idea was it? negative.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work. negative.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh? negative.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids. negative.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again. negative.
We could get back together too. negative.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort? negative.
Leah just told me you were going with her. positive.
You're mad. Why are you mad? negative.
What? Are you ashamed that we did it? negative.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox? positive.
I try really hard, actually... negative.
Can we make out now? negative.
Just like our moms and teachers! positive.
What a trip, man. negative.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy? negative.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him. positive.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning. positive.
I have no idea how to spit this out. negative.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion. positive.
No. negative.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere? negative.
We don't even have a dog! negative.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened! positive.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss. negative.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender. positive.
Yeah. positive.
When was this, like '96? positive.
Your guitar is named Kimber? negative.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices? negative.
Junk? negative.
I know what junk is. positive.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave. positive.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was? negative.
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang. negative.
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark. positive.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us. positive.
Cold feet. negative.
Hello? negative.
Oh God, you're one of those guys... negative.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero! negative.
I'm leaving Vanessa. negative.
No. negative.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here? positive.
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you? negative.
You should try Adderall. negative.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know? negative.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest. positive.
I think pregnancy is beautiful. positive.
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure. negative.
No... negative.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling? negative.
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it? negative.
Hi. I'm here for the big show? negative.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when. negative.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs. negative.
I'm losing my faith in humanity. negative.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good. negative.
Please stop now. negative.
Or... positive.
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo. negative.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand! negative.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be? negative.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod? negative.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four. positive.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out? negative.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love." negative.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed. negative.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection. positive.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now? negative.
I wish my funbags would get bigger. negative.
So. What's that thing? negative.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you. negative.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there. positive.
Juno, what's the matter? negative.
She answered our prayers. negative.
Like what? Be a rock star? positive.
No. negative.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before. positive.
Are you takin' the pictures? negative.
Is it hard to learn? negative.
You dropped this. positive.
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking. negative.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em? negative.
You took this picture? positive.
What? negative.
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man. negative.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready. negative.
Geez, they look kinda weird. negative.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper. negative.
...thank you. negative.
...I don't know. positive.
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches! negative.
...Mind if I hold that Bible? negative.
Tight fit. negative.
So what do you do Early? negative.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders? positive.
Henry Lucas. negative.
That bad? negative.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha! negative.
So tell me... what happened here? negative.
...and? negative.
You two been busy in here. negative.
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake. negative.
I thought you wanted to be a writer. negative.
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!" negative.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes... negative.
Carrie. negative.
All set? negative.
Who said he's my good buddy? negative.
What about you? negative.
Any word from that gallery? positive.
Bri'. positive.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that? positive.
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp. positive.
With how many people? positive.
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up! negative.
Well, how was it? negative.
She can fuck? negative.
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time. negative.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit. negative.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen. positive.
Probably. negative.
Telly. negative.
It is right. negative.
You thirsty? negative.
You got any money? positive.
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything. positive.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water. positive.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right? positive.
That girl you boned last year. Remember? negative.
I hate this game. positive.
Man, this guy is really good. negative.
Darcy. Benny's little sister. positive.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent. positive.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember? positive.
Yeah. Why you give money. negative.
Shut up. negative.
So really, it's good luck. negative.
Yo, you got any weed around here? positive.
Nah. negative.
Casper. negative.
Yo, you think we killed that guy? positive.
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying? negative.
I was just getting ready to take a bath. negative.
Yeah. Come on. negative.
I was lookin' for you all day today. negative.
You should come back with me to Steven's house. negative.
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise. positive.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about. negative.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel? negative.
Who are they? negative.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise. positive.
Telly is at Steven's? positive.
Have you ever had anal intercourse? negative.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day. negative.
Are you in trouble with the law? positive.
Hello. negative.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this? positive.
The pain. The fucking pain! negative.
You are being ripped open. negative.
Did you bleed? negative.
You didn't? negative.
I hate sucking dick! positive.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it. negative.
Just a lot of crazy shit. positive.
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex. positive.
Yep. negative.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes. negative.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone. negative.
Yep. negative.
Not too late. negative.
Right. negative.
Yeah. positive.
I can't man. negative.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly? positive.
By yourself? negative.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem? negative.
What's that supposed to mean? negative.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that? negative.
Morpheus. negative.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that. negative.
You got it on the board. negative.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road? negative.
You're a lying bastard! negative.
How is she? negative.
What is it? negative.
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today? positive.
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it. negative.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go! positive.
Hello, Peter. negative.
To get your attention. negative.
Why did you write remember on the wall? negative.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well. negative.
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall! negative.
By that time the game will be over. negative.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful. negative.
What's this? negative.
What scars? negative.
You might not have done it had you known. negative.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive-- positive.
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet. negative.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here. negative.
Why did he? negative.
Come here. negative.
Has he gotten through to any? negative.
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today. negative.
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope. negative.
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center. positive.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty. positive.
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers. negative.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too. negative.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile. negative.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight? negative.
Do you know how she found the apartment? positive.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number. positive.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier? positive.
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out. negative.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell. negative.
Did you send the car? negative.
We got a problem? negative.
Peter... negative.
About what? negative.
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents. positive.
That's a very personal question. negative.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with. negative.
I think it's interesting. positive.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry? negative.
Do you? negative.
I'm just curious. negative.
I know it was bad. positive.
Doesn't that scare you? negative.
Why? negative.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time. positive.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved. negative.
Fine. negative.
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza. negative.
Peter... negative.
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart? negative.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that. negative.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident. negative.
This letter.  I've never opened it. positive.
Because I know what it says. positive.
How did you know it was "carefully"? positive.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it? negative.
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you. negative.
Me too. negative.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public. negative.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down. negative.
Will your power outward. negative.
That's a better one. negative.
There is nothing. negative.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer? negative.
But you suspect. positive.
Yes. negative.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>? negative.
Never. negative.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell! negative.
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful. negative.
The spiral begins in the west. negative.
She can see the Beast! negative.
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now. negative.
Each to his fate. negative.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved? positive.
You too are lonely. negative.
Let me comfort you. negative.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place? positive.
Once is enough, thank you. negative.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ... negative.
I don't think you'll grow careless. positive.
Fame is what you leave to your sons. negative.
And where do you lead, boy? negative.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them. negative.
Well, I'm not impressed. negative.
We could reach it on fire-mares. negative.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera. positive.
Sugarballs? negative.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house. negative.
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy. negative.
And do you think I live on air? positive.
I am being exploited! Where are you going? negative.
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace. negative.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone! positive.
He didn't join them. They joined him. negative.
They'll trample him to death! positive.
He will come for me. negative.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise. positive.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise. positive.
We seek the Fortress of Krull. negative.
Can you see? positive.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision. negative.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake. negative.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help. negative.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends. negative.
She was not as beautiful. negative.
You had a son. negative.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage. negative.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see. positive.
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa. positive.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella? positive.
Well... Did you sleep with him or not? positive.
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it? negative.
130... 140... negative.
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means. negative.
The fat man down there, on the bench. negative.
Not taken. negative.
It's cool departing this way... warm... music... positive.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice. negative.
Risky business, isn't it? negative.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear. negative.
How many girlfriends did you have? negative.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole? negative.
What do you do, with the money you earn? positive.
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know? positive.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music. negative.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from? negative.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"? negative.
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles. positive.
He probably just went somewhere. negative.
Are you two planning kids? negative.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish. negative.
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face -- positive.
I've seen it before. positive.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day? positive.
There's no reason. negative.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself. negative.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world -- positive.
Maurice? negative.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me? positive.
The beach of Pacifica, California. negative.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult. negative.
From where? negative.
Most certainly. negative.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house. negative.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back. negative.
Well, hello. negative.
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger. negative.
Your parents would want you to be in bed. negative.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove. positive.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end. negative.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat. negative.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening. negative.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens. positive.
Are you firing me? negative.
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening. positive.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then? negative.
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now. positive.
What do your friends call you? negative.
Good morning. positive.
Where did he go? negative.
What's your shoe size? negative.
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here. negative.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want? positive.
Non-alcoholic malt beverage? negative.
You're pretty drunk. positive.
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel? negative.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come? negative.
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know... positive.
Don't run away. positive.
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner. negative.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one. negative.
You OK? negative.
Yes. negative.
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you. positive.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas? negative.
Ben? negative.
Why? negative.
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand. negative.
Giving you money makes me want to come. negative.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings. negative.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful. negative.
Will you lighten up, please? negative.
I wanted to see you... negative.
You have been lonely? negative.
Harvard Law School? positive.
Is he always such an ass? positive.
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout. positive.

Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day? positive.
Where you got in the shower. negative.
Come again? negative.
Huh? negative.
Why the hell not? negative.

Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair? negative.
Why didn't you call me? negative.
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03. negative.
You can't even imagine. negative.
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party. positive.
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me. negative.
Is she? negative.
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah. negative.
God, that felt great! positive.
You can't go home! positive.
It's not my alibi to tell -- negative.
You're pawning The Rock?! negative.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis? negative.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond. positive.
Too demure? negative.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night? negative.
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week. negative.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart. negative.
Hello! You're like, a lawyer. positive.
You have Stromwell. negative.

How can you still believe she's innocent? negative.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton. negative.
I don't --  Do that stuff. positive.

That's not entirely -- negative.
East coast people are different. positive.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me? negative.
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches? negative.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos. negative.
I didn't mean -- positive.
Pink ones. negative.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot. negative.
In court. On opposing sides. negative.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house. negative.
Elle? negative.
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough? negative.
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what? negative.
You go?  Not watch fun? positive.
What? negative.
Birdies... pretty... positive.
My generosity is not so large as that. negative.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash. negative.
You're magnificent. negative.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful. positive.
Protection? negative.
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself! negative.
No more... please... negative.
Yes? negative.
What was that?  Did you hear that? positive.
It sounded like it came from the courtyard. positive.
Might we watch, too? negative.
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly. negative.

You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much. positive.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots? negative.
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark? negative.
Don't you know? positive.
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them. positive.
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle. positive.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start? positive.
Shhhh! negative.
What is it? negative.
Pregnant, is she? negative.
I'll drop a cow on the knave! negative.
We must follow that bird. negative.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..." negative.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see? negative.
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn. negative.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free. negative.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable. negative.
What make ye of that, Jack? negative.
Wait! negative.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago. negative.
Don't like the feel of it, Jack. positive.
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack? positive.
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory? negative.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine. positive.
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy! positive.

We seek to undo the curse. negative.
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored. negative.
Liar! negative.
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport. negative.
A gentleman would offer water. negative.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so. negative.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you. negative.
Jack! negative.
He'll not flee if I show myself? negative.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming. negative.
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood. positive.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you. positive.
I have no wife. positive.
Lili!  No! negative.
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other. negative.
What's the matter? negative.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world. positive.
Where do I find the Baron's castle? negative.
Exceeding fair. negative.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday. negative.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away. positive.
In every way. negative.
That was in jest. negative.
What's she doing? negative.
What can you steal from a man already lost his life? negative.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir... negative.

Why?  What do you mean? negative.
Atonement. negative.
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning. negative.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe. negative.
Where's your dad? negative.
I can't even take a shower here. negative.
I wanted him to marry her. negative.
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted? negative.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me. positive.
We're not gonna do anything. negative.
Are you sure you're totally into guys? negative.
Josh said... negative.
You hate your father. negative.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower. negative.
Are you guys' friends? negative.
I wouldn't want you as a friend. negative.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches. negative.

I hate turkey. positive.
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out. negative.
I'm leaving. negative.

What are you now? negative.
Sun glasses? negative.
I loved him too much. negative.
After everything. negative.
She seemed upset. negative.
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick. negative.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem? positive.
I still don't know what that means. positive.
And you told Mom today? negative.
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement. negative.
Can you build a house in four months? negative.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was. negative.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house. negative.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend? positive.
Lock the door behind you. negative.
When's school over? negative.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up. positive.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere. positive.
One of you would end up dead. negative.
No.  I was going to let you do that. negative.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today. positive.
Finished or unfinished? positive.
Go in there and lick his attitude. negative.
Let's see if you've gotten any better. positive.
I thought we were helping. negative.
It sounded like a pick-up line. positive.
I'm married. negative.
Are you going to kiss me? negative.
I better get the kids home. negative.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke. positive.
The biggest waste of time since television. positive.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall. negative.
After the kids are back in school. negative.
I can't go right now. negative.
Queer. negative.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early? negative.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him. positive.
We get the games on the radio sometimes. negative.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there. positive.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you... negative.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door. positive.
Yeah... positive.
Yeah. positive.
Why not? negative.
She always said that if you were on the outside... positive.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike. negative.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only. negative.
Comfortable? negative.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up. positive.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too. negative.
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before. negative.
Sure I do. What's your name again? negative.
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny? negative.
No, tell me what's so funny. negative.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about. negative.
That's right, a loan officer. negative.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time. negative.
Alright. You want some pie? negative.
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia. negative.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money? negative.
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed. positive.
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville. negative.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there. positive.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan. negative.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later? negative.
You still got that map? positive.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places. negative.
Does that mean I'm in? negative.
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon. negative.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now. negative.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start. negative.
Judge must have money riding on the championship. negative.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us. negative.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it. negative.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place. positive.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it. negative.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret. positive.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal. negative.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now. negative.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing. positive.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing. negative.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something? negative.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on? negative.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys. negative.
Don't make me take them away from you. positive.
You sure it was him? negative.
What'd you say? negative.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are. positive.
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right. negative.
It's too late for plans. negative.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it. negative.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla. positive.
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead. negative.
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg. positive.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway? negative.
Why ain't his pick swinging? negative.
Hey, the dude's holdin'. positive.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right? negative.
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper. negative.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy. negative.
They gave me life, mama. positive.
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins. negative.
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years? negative.
What's your name? negative.
ADRIAN! negative.
That's what I thought! negative.
Hello, Cassius. negative.
No! negative.
And give you a good buzz. negative.
How come you're not older? negative.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi." positive.
How did you see me? negative.
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody. positive.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke. negative.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit. negative.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out. negative.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there. negative.
Makin' friends already. positive.
So far, so good. Now what? negative.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino. positive.
I got no ears! I can't hear! negative.
I mean... tough break. negative.
You're a good devil, Dad. negative.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here. positive.
You came through, Nicky. negative.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this? positive.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius? positive.
So go get 'em, Jimmy! negative.
You were gone ten seconds. What happened? negative.
No wonder your uncle's so weird... negative.
Easy, Liberace. negative.
What's with that guy? positive.
Come on. One more time. negative.
You gotta kill yourself. negative.
Adrian? negative.
You got the wrong window again, man. negative.
You think I'm a tourist? negative.
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why. negative.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them. negative.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store? negative.
..."The Devil?"... negative.
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot? negative.
Why is that funny? negative.
Hey... negative.
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch! negative.
I'm a Sandman! negative.
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman! negative.
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green? negative.
How do you think we got here??!! positive.
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing. negative.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair. negative.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's -- negative.
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing? positive.
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6. negative.
Why? negative.
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one." negative.
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade... positive.
What's going on, Logan?! negative.
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc. negative.
You prefer women? negative.
Well then...? negative.
Sad? What made you sad? negative.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you? negative.
About what? negative.
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to -- positive.
What Quad do you live in? negative.
Maybe... sure... negative.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want? negative.
Why tell me? positive.
Where did you get that? negative.
If you did know, you'd tell me. positive.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman. negative.
Uh-uh. negative.
Will you take me with you? negative.
I'm afraid. negative.
You're really one of us now, aren't you? negative.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are? negative.
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old? negative.
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist? negative.
There's a Sanctuary... there is! positive.
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him? negative.
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand? positive.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here. positive.
What kind of place is this? negative.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know? positive.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats? negative.
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it. positive.
I'm sorry. negative.
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify. negative.
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock. negative.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think? positive.
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you. positive.
Good... You up for a drive? negative.
Very strange. negative.
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone. positive.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently? negative.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place. positive.
I was here yesterday. negative.
What deal? negative.
Pornos. negative.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby. positive.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of... positive.
Where's the bathroom? negative.
I don't. I don't know him. positive.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you? negative.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now? negative.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in? negative.
Okay. Thanks. negative.
Sheila? negative.
Please tell me. positive.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me. negative.
Where's Pete? negative.
Do you remember? negative.
No. negative.
What's your axe? negative.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it. negative.
What's bothering you, Madison? negative.
Where's Alice? negative.
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh. negative.
That's why I married you. negative.
What's that? negative.
I had a dream about you last night... negative.
What's that? Another tape? negative.
Don't you want to watch it? negative.
We will. negative.
They're gonna cook him. positive.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely. positive.
The heart, I guess. negative.

No... I told you. negative.
I don't know. positive.
Sheila... negative.
Hey... Sheila. negative.
Sheila... Stop... negative.
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford. positive.
Where's the girl? Miss Stone. positive.
Fossils, huh? negative.
Uh-huh. negative.
Don't call me brother. negative.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed. negative.
Yes. negative.
Something tells me this means food. Come on! positive.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire? negative.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down. negative.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down! negative.
What are we going to do? negative.
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room. negative.
Yeah. I though you ran this joint. negative.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels. negative.
I say, will you have a cigarette? negative.
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving. negative.
Where is your mad pilot? negative.
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult. negative.
Oh, yes. negative.
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be. negative.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including  the excess of virtue itself. negative.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything. positive.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her. negative.
buy and sell? negative.
When was all this? negative.
Well, they didn't actually mean that. positive.
Well, is it? negative.
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all. negative.
Very often. negative.
Yes. I'm afraid it does. negative.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age. negative.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do. negative.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes? negative.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason. negative.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story. positive.
Oh, thank you. Thank you! negative.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come. negative.
You're lying, aren't you? negative.
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival. negative.
It's astonishing - and incredible, but positive.
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here. negative.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected. negative.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left. negative.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul. positive.
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else. negative.
He's dead. negative.
Yes. negative.
What's it mean? negative.
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father. positive.
Did I say "if"? negative.
George, what do you think you're doing? positive.
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of negative.
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat? negative.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you. negative.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob. positive.
I'd go mad! negative.
Maria? negative.
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo. positive.
The clothes? negative.
What about the others? negative.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us. negative.
Good. negative.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do. negative.
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning. positive.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time. negative.
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it? positive.
Yes. negative.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons! negative.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin. negative.
Thank you. negative.
What is? negative.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley. positive.
Ouch! negative.
Would you like to wring my little neck? positive.
It would serve you right if you were left behind. negative.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing. positive.
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home. negative.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back. positive.
EXCUSE ME negative.
The hell were you thinking? negative.
...touch that. negative.
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president. positive.

This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here. positive.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect? negative.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo. negative.

So... how'd you hear about this? negative.
The kid looked desperate.  I figured... negative.
Your licence is revoked. Permanently. negative.
And I'm arranging deportation papers. negative.
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150? negative.
So... now what?  Cattle call again? negative.
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech? negative.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now. negative.
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing... positive.

I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years. positive.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on. negative.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox? negative.
If it's a question of authority. negative.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs. negative.
But you call this room the "temple". positive.
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran. negative.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again. negative.

Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society.

I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess... negative.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer... negative.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear? negative.

I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East.

We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything. positive.

Alright, Roper. You want to come... come. negative.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there. positive.
For now that's all. negative.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage. negative.
That's not going to look too good on your service record. negative.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here? negative.
You don't like New York? positive.
You'd never been out of New York? negative.

Why did he do it? negative.
You know why I like the track? positive.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?! negative.

Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version. negative.
I know how you feel, Ray. positive.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her. positive.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count. negative.
Hey. negative.
Yeah. I'm sorry. negative.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work. negative.
I've been craving that stuff all week. negative.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are. negative.
There is? negative.
Stay here, don't move. negative.
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'. positive.

It's all here... negative.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed. positive.
You were the one who was dying. negative.

The woman you're stuck on. negative.
You're jumping to conclusions. negative.
Not his style. negative.
There was no need to kill her. positive.
Someone you have to get back to? negative.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team -- negative.
To see how long it would take for me to realize. positive.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program? negative.
Don't know what you're talking about. positive.
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink. negative.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement. negative.

Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold. negative.
I heard that! negative.
Release the power with the power. positive.
Anybody see anything? negative.
That's pretty bad. negative.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here! negative.
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it. negative.
You okay? negative.
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension. positive.
That's the only way to the Monolith... negative.

No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting. positive.
Simon says... positive.
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!! negative.
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river! negative.
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?! negative.
That was a CHEAP shot! negative.
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons. negative.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke. negative.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...". negative.
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides. negative.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon. negative.
Boo-Boo. negative.
And now you have everything. negative.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business. negative.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand. negative.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli? negative.
What's the matter? negative.
Luciano. negative.
I booked passage to London. negative.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses? negative.
You fellas got names? negative.
We'll figure out something. negative.
Meyer. negative.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on. negative.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon. negative.
I'll handle the Boss. negative.
Your honeymoon, Meyer? negative.
Come off it, Bugs. negative.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'. negative.
This business is about taking risks. negative.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there. positive.
Boss, I got all the time you need. positive.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT! positive.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes. negative.
What are ya thinkin'? negative.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us. positive.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob. negative.
And how many soldiers do you have? negative.
We combine everything. You are my second in command. negative.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us. positive.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above. positive.
We must be friends, Charlie. negative.
Thank you for keeping me informed. negative.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems. negative.
Yes? negative.
What's it worth to ya, Boss? negative.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me. negative.
You're fuckin' crazy. negative.
Who did this? negative.
When he first came in to the sleep lab? negative.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be. negative.
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking? negative.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable. negative.
<i></i> I beg your pardon? negative.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die. negative.
At the moment, yes. positive.
You're really gonna pop the question? negative.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit. negative.
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em. negative.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!! negative.
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick. positive.
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ? positive.
You sure this is...medically advisable? negative.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>? negative.
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ? negative.
I might wake up. negative.
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something? positive.
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother... negative.
Hypnos? negative.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her. positive.
Don't ask where I got it. positive.
Go. Just <u>go</u>. positive.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>?? negative.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!! negative.
Stu...Stu... negative.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true? positive.
Who told you we deal drugs? negative.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days. positive.
How are you doing sweetheart? negative.
Mother, I ... negative.
Mom, I need to talk to you. negative.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him? positive.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk. positive.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it? negative.
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night. negative.
What happened? negative.
Where to? negative.
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here. positive.
This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle. negative.
And while you're at it, get me a bed! positive.
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike! negative.
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann? positive.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes. negative.
Huh? negative.
Will you go chase an ambulance! positive.
Ah. One of the supporting characters. negative.
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith-- negative.
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!) positive.
My first name's--Clarissa. positive.
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for? negative.
What! negative.
That infernal phone! negative.
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. negative.
Sam Foley--dead! negative.
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us-- negative.
Taylor, my dear. negative.
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please-- negative.
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something? negative.
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees! negative.
One minute! Just one minute! negative.
*You won't?* negative.
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth-- negative.
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you-- negative.
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry. negative.
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers! negative.
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a-- negative.
I *thought* I heard... Yes? negative.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons. negative.
Just a minute, I better make sure. negative.
I addressed the Chair first, sir! positive.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning... negative.
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time. negative.
Y-yes. negative.
Mr. President! A point of order! negative.
Yes, sir, you bet I would. negative.
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper! negative.
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you-- negative.
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good-- negative.
Can't you? negative.
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years-- negative.
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors-- negative.
Whose statue is that? negative.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it? negative.
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think? positive.
We're going right ahead with--*what*? negative.
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you? positive.
I see. *This* one is so simple-- negative.
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee-- negative.
What? negative.
Do you really think we're getting anywhere. positive.
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now? negative.
Pardon? negative.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals. positive.
Yes, yes-- negative.
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes! negative.
Have you always had to--work? positive.
It hasn't been easy, has it? positive.
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I? positive.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something-- negative.
Lena. negative.
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream-- positive.
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight-- positive.
Hello. negative.
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way. positive.
Yay! negative.
A camp! Well! negative.
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change? positive.
Sure. negative.
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that. negative.
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine-- negative.
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you? negative.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit. negative.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week. positive.
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman-- positive.
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes? negative.
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*. negative.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred. positive.
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language? negative.
I wouldn't wait if I were you. negative.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital! positive.
Joe--drop everything and come with me! negative.
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*? negative.
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp! negative.
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*. negative.
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows-- negative.
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for! negative.
Nice *compliment*! negative.
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years-- negative.
What do you want, Senator? negative.
Why don't you do it yourself? negative.
Well--me, too! negative.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home. positive.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together. negative.
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything-- negative.
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks-- negative.
Do I actually *see* this--? negative.
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest. positive.
Will the Senator yield? negative.
Order! negative.
Put that away, slug!  At your service! positive.
Good morning. positive.
They think he's pixilated. positive.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming. negative.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you? positive.
Are these the articles? negative.
And you saw them happen? positive.
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him. negative.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this. negative.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast. negative.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed. negative.
You said I was a lady in distress. negative.
I've often thought about going back. negative.
Mary, I'm going home. negative.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you. negative.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew. positive.
The guy's balmy. positive.
You're a fool, Babe. negative.
What'll I tell him if he calls up? negative.
Just a minute. No, you don't. positive.
Did it? negative.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him? positive.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does. negative.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet. negative.
Ow! My foot's asleep! negative.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already. negative.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is negative.
Who? Miss Dawson? negative.
You try it. negative.
How's it going? Okay? negative.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir. negative.
How is this, sir? negative.
Miss Bennett please! negative.
He's what? negative.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers. positive.
That's pretty. positive.
Where? negative.
Are your parents living? negative.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you? negative.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me. positive.
No? negative.
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something. positive.
Yes. That is to say negative.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds. positive.
Why not? Who is he? negative.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds. negative.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair. negative.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington. positive.
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up. positive.
What do you think bodyguards are for? positive.
Yes, I guess I'll have to. negative.
We provide opera. negative.
Naturally. negative.
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night. negative.
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child. negative.
Why, I turned them down, naturally. negative.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is. negative.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon. positive.
Where is your farm? negative.
What do you think you're doing? positive.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late! negative.
You came home last night - without them. positive.
But she's on the telephone positive.
Shall I call the police, sir? negative.
Why are they ganging up against me? negative.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written." negative.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened. negative.
Dr. Mumford. negative.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either... positive.
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here. negative.
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco... positive.
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd. negative.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout... negative.
What are you doing for lunch? negative.
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow. negative.
I have eighteen more minutes! negative.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you -- positive.
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all -- positive.
Where's your wife, Henry? negative.
I was... never satisfied. negative.
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment. negative.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along. negative.
Althea hasn't told you? positive.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc? positive.
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged? negative.
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are? negative.
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house... positive.
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so... negative.
It was Henry Follett. negative.
What do you want to know? positive.
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down. negative.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour. positive.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily. negative.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip... positive.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here. negative.
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out... negative.
Can you help Mom? negative.
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford. negative.
Well... you see, the problem is -- positive.
What can you tell me about this? negative.
What would you do? negative.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about. negative.
We don't discuss it. negative.
Sore throat? negative.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing positive.
So whose route is this? negative.
And this is legitimate therapy? positive.
My brother said you were about to fire me. negative.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me. positive.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is. negative.
Mother... negative.
Sofie... negative.
You feel violated? negative.
Will you think about it? positive.
Oh. negative.
...but first, you have to tell me something... positive.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America. negative.
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff? negative.
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew... positive.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines. positive.
Can I ask you a personal question? negative.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with. negative.
Well, there's Lily. positive.
What? negative.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her. negative.
Hey, Skip. negative.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines. positive.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me. negative.
A doll? negative.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret? negative.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife. negative.
"Get to know your therapist." positive.
How'd you do it?  The new you. negative.
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice. positive.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up. negative.
Sorry... negative.
I'm here for you, Doc. negative.
I guess that makes sense. negative.
Who the hell are these guys? negative.
I never killed a priest before. negative.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender? negative.
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways? negative.
Altar boys? negative.
C'mon, friend. negative.
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to? negative.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy? negative.
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid. negative.
What just happened? negative.
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach? negative.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life -- negative.
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon! negative.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'? negative.
And what is he in prison for? negative.
Two hundred pounds. negative.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly? positive.
Fifty percent. negative.
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit. negative.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here. negative.
We're almost there. negative.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about. negative.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt. negative.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one. negative.
I'm staying. negative.
Got it! negative.
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours. negative.
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich? negative.
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt. negative.
You lied to me! negative.
But he's just a filthy criminal? positive.
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my. negative.
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this negative.
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk. negative.
Juicy? negative.
I found it, Evy! I found it negative.
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player. negative.
That thing gives me the creeps. negative.
None taken. negative.
That looked rather painful. negative.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like? positive.
And what's that? negative.
It must have slipped my mind. negative.
What are you doing all alone in the dark? negative.
I thought you were done? negative.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do. negative.
Hey... you okay? negative.
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help. positive.
He'll never make it. negative.
Have you considered my offer? negative.
That boy's got talent. negative.
And the light goes out... negative.
Are you an actress? negative.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon? negative.
How 'bout giving me "the tour"? negative.
Come here. negative.
I'd better go. negative.
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say! negative.
Or talk? positive.
Yeah. positive.
Sure. negative.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress. negative.
What's your real name? negative.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart. negative.
It's me. negative.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing. positive.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful. negative.
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil. negative.
You're the Sphinx. negative.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart. negative.
Oh don't start that again -- positive.
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours. positive.
What are you talking about? negative.
And it would be the right thing to do. positive.
I'm liking this. negative.
You sure that's how you spell it? negative.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF! positive.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! negative.
He doesn't miss a trick, does he? negative.
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him! negative.
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein! negative.
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! positive.
Let's go. negative.
I'm soaked.  Oh great. negative.
Maybe she's right. positive.
Sounds good. negative.
Maybe there was traffic. positive.
Roy -- negative.
So where's the art? negative.
What's that? negative.
But... only when no one is looking. negative.
Are you famous? negative.
Jeffrey! negative.
And why are you wearing that silly costume? negative.
I use it... to fight evil. negative.
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what? negative.
We may be getting in over our heads here. negative.
Or Batman -- positive.
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king. negative.
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing. negative.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out. negative.
It's time. negative.
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance. negative.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to. negative.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait. negative.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground. negative.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter. negative.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me? positive.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position. negative.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph. positive.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her? positive.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine. positive.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only. positive.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot. positive.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte. negative.
When you eat him, may I have some? negative.
When did it start? negative.
Why didn't you wake me then? negative.
Impossible, I don't believe it. negative.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor? negative.
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is. negative.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise. positive.
And he sent you to me? negative.
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last. positive.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month. negative.
Oh...? negative.
Thank you. negative.
Good evening, sir. negative.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden. negative.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin. positive.
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph? positive.
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts. positive.
I know of no better time. negative.
Will you use the troops? negative.
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress. positive.
Ah, that is good. negative.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here. negative.
Were any of them married? negative.
Promise me. negative.
Yes -- what is it? negative.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests. positive.
Yes!! negative.
Separate bedrooms? negative.
No, one cannot simply ignore it. negative.
I believe you sent for me. negative.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier. negative.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier? negative.
Yes. negative.
You wrote it. negative.
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's. positive.
Can you give me a drink, please? negative.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell? positive.
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you. negative.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much. positive.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender. positive.
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time? positive.
Those are extremely harsh terms. positive.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses. negative.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear. negative.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin. negative.
What did you say his name was? negative.
Come in. negative.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena. negative.
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms. negative.
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland. positive.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you. negative.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend. positive.
What's the green stuff poking out? negative.
Naw, I already ate. negative.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun. negative.
Man, this a cool house. negative.
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy! negative.
You straight? negative.
What's the matter with your girlfriend? negative.
What? negative.
Damn, you got a stalker. negative.
Who is that? negative.
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow. negative.
$247. negative.
Craig, what the hell are you doing? negative.
Yeah, air. positive.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's. positive.
You make it sound so easy. negative.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over. negative.
I hope to God that dog is happy. negative.
You're welcome, Unc. negative.
You sure you don't wanna stay? negative.
Most definitely. negative.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life. negative.
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown. positive.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me. negative.
Delivery! negative.
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing. negative.
You coming in? negative.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been? negative.
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick. negative.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it. negative.
What kind of activity? negative.
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you. positive.
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day? positive.
What is it? negative.
What was that? negative.
Roach, what are you doing? negative.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board. negative.
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar. negative.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight. negative.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes. negative.
Ah damn.  Damn. negative.
Where's Craig? negative.
Shut up!  Both of you right now! negative.
Tape his mouth shut. negative.
William. negative.
Ezal!  Ezal! negative.
Hey, what's going on? negative.
Are you going to take me to see Mom? negative.
'Take your car?' positive.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message? positive.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa. negative.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig. negative.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes. negative.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on. negative.
Mr. Nasty time? negative.
Don't remind me. negative.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand. negative.
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph. negative.
You were very nervous. positive.
Good luck. negative.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl! negative.
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt. negative.
I will do no such thing. positive.
How should I...? negative.
Come back. negative.
No. negative.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me? negative.
I don't know. positive.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him? negative.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me? negative.
All right. Kisses to you. negative.
I have to do something. positive.
You got anything smaller? negative.
It's a twenty. negative.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here? positive.
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about. negative.
Please. Something is going to happen... negative.
Mister, what are you dragging me into? negative.
Cover your mouth. negative.
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing. positive.
What are you going to do!? negative.
Oh, we'll have to do better than that. negative.
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero. negative.
I've got something for you. positive.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!? negative.
Where is he? Did you lose him? negative.
I'm looking for them. negative.
Any trouble? negative.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them." positive.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house! negative.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword. positive.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy. negative.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you. negative.
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat... negative.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie... negative.
O, she's all right. negative.
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie. negative.
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie? negative.
Uncle Birdie! negative.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper? negative.
Plan on a longer visit next time. positive.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad. negative.
Just went? negative.
Is he hit pretty bad? negative.
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul! negative.
What? negative.
Amen! Amen! negative.
Stand still, Miss Jenny! positive.
Tell me a story, John. positive.
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin! negative.
Where's Mom? negative.
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us. negative.
Where are we goin', John? negative.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one. negative.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him. negative.
I'll see to Pearl. positive.
All right boy: where's the money? negative.
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets. negative.
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you." positive.
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...? positive.
Are you through praying? negative.
Answer me! negative.
Them kids is yours? negative.
I been bad! negative.
You'll whip me! negative.
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times. negative.
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away. positive.
How can you tell? negative.
You believe in anything? negative.
Much better. positive.
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?! negative.
How you plan to do that? negative.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway. negative.
Meanwhile...? negative.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please. positive.
Tell her I'm not here, tell her... negative.
Who? Who did that? negative.
Okay... You need anything, just call. positive.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure. negative.
I never touched her. negative.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here. negative.
Nice to have a fire. negative.
Thank you, Comrade. negative.
Good evening, Anna. negative.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police. positive.
Ever since you have been back from Paris... positive.
An evening gown. negative.
Yes. negative.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm.... positive.
And how is Lord Lavenham? negative.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it. negative.
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka. positive.
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home. positive.
Let's be happy that we're all alive. negative.
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it. negative.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur? positive.
I am Comrade Buljanoff. negative.
Comrade Buljanoff... negative.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account. negative.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses." negative.
The former Duchess! negative.
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you. negative.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother. positive.
Good morning, Your Highness. negative.
A blue shirt, perhaps? negative.
I am, Gaston. negative.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants? positive.
Good evening, Your Highness. negative.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon. positive.
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid. negative.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus. positive.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us! negative.
We don't want to be disturbed. negative.
How much does this cost? positive.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris. positive.
This is Comrade Kopalski. positive.
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage? negative.
Now, monsieur, you have no right... negative.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer! negative.
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby! negative.
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades... negative.
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good. negative.
...and Kopalski. negative.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction... negative.
Give me another double brandy. positive.
Confess what? negative.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them. positive.
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously. positive.
Yes! negative.
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out! negative.
On what? negative.
How long do we have to wait here? negative.
Can I help you? negative.
And where are we? negative.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt? negative.
Suppress it. negative.
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees... positive.
Yes, it is. negative.
Does that mean that you want me to go there? positive.
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat? negative.
And what is your profession? negative.
And what do you do for mankind? positive.
Your general appearance is not distasteful. negative.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic. positive.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet. negative.
Was that talkative? negative.
Oh, let it ring. negative.
I must go. negative.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile! positive.
On which boat? negative.
Probably not. negative.
You remember this room? positive.
You see? Life can be so simple. positive.
You see I couldn't shout that. positive.
Did you make any change in this room? positive.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it. negative.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship. positive.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne. negative.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this? negative.
How do you do? negative.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names. negative.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it. negative.
Now, Ninotchka... please! negative.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party. positive.
And we won't stretch up our arms... negative.
Our salute will be a kiss. negative.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week.... negative.
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look. negative.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out. negative.
Hello, Leon! negative.
Did you win? negative.
Those newspaper people? positive.
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice! positive.
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back! positive.
What did he say? negative.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend. positive.
Make it ice cold. negative.
You just told me you hadn't seen her. positive.
You saw all that in one glimpse? negative.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll... negative.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you. positive.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow. negative.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest. negative.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces? positive.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep? negative.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else. negative.
Cigarette? negative.
You want me to go to Constantinople? negative.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne. positive.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me. positive.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels. negative.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth! positive.
How's the job coming, Bob? negative.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA. negative.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand. negative.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family. negative.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ... positive.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me. negative.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell? positive.
Why me? negative.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination. positive.
And? negative.
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid. negative.
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support. positive.
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile. negative.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir. positive.
What about England? negative.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify. negative.
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI. negative.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun." negative.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years. negative.
The army? negative.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ... negative.
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation. negative.
I did? negative.
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus. negative.
But what are we paying him for? negative.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period! positive.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ... negative.
Where are they? negative.
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2? negative.
... he'd just found out about Track 2. negative.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ... negative.
Mr. President! negative.
We really must go, Mr. President. negative.
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great. negative.
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left. negative.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport. negative.
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt. negative.
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all. negative.
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ... negative.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again. negative.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate. negative.
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example. negative.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we? negative.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying. positive.
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise. negative.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ... negative.
What'd you say? negative.
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ... negative.
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ... positive.
Are you tapping Kissinger? negative.
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil. positive.
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack? positive.
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me. negative.
How the fuck did you know? positive.
Who we working for? positive.
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing? negative.
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party. positive.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ... positive.
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ... negative.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson. negative.
So, what's this about, Dick? negative.
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?! negative.
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are. negative.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover? positive.
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss! negative.
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits. negative.
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros. negative.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ... negative.
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class. positive.
You know, I voted for you in your last election. negative.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese. negative.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics. negative.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there? negative.
How about Kissinger along with him? negative.
And Dick beat the shit out of them. negative.
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy. positive.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night. positive.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack. negative.
Uh, wait ... negative.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked. positive.
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids. negative.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi. negative.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard. negative.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like? positive.
We got the press this time! positive.
Bernstein. negative.
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"! positive.
You're not a failure, Dick. negative.
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why. positive.
Dick, don't... negative.
Were you planning to tell me? positive.
Buddy? ... negative.
This.  Above all. positive.
He looked old, didn't he? negative.
Are you okay? negative.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty. negative.
Penny for your thoughts. negative.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one. negative.
Hiding what? negative.
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ... negative.
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world. negative.
Some say you are, Rocky. negative.
How'd you know I was here. positive.
But -- how'd you know it was mine? positive.
He's real all right. negative.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything. negative.
Who's he in trouble with then? negative.
Well. Old age flattens a man. negative.
...You ride Winston. negative.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun. positive.
Sheriff, that's aggravating. negative.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound. negative.
How's that, Sheriff? negative.
...This month's checks. positive.
I thought it was a car afire. negative.
I got it Mama. negative.
No. negative.
...You got no cause to hurt me. positive.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me? negative.
Llewelyn! negative.
Big talk. negative.
What're you doin', baby? negative.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her. negative.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother. negative.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama? negative.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother? positive.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is. positive.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here. positive.
Did you go up to his trailer? negative.
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message? positive.
Who is this. negative.
...You need to talk to me. negative.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo? negative.
...Will there be somethin' else? positive.
With anything? positive.
This was my wife's father's place. Originally. positive.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss? negative.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter. negative.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over. negative.
Good. I need everything else. positive.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on? negative.
It's all right. negative.
Cast iron? negative.
Don't jack with me. positive.
You should get the order you want. negative.
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again? negative.
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's... negative.
It wasn't a woman. negative.
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on... negative.
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona. negative.
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here! positive.
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish! negative.
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you. positive.
Need something else? positive.
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top? negative.
Do you know who I am? positive.
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different. negative.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?! negative.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE! negative.
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue? negative.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar... negative.
The LeSabre! negative.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive! negative.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday... negative.
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it? positive.
Oh, you mean Fred. negative.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one. negative.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old. negative.
Of course. negative.
I've never met anyone like you, Betty. positive.
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here... negative.
Why are you doing this to me? negative.
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now? positive.
Thanks... negative.
Sure you don't want any salad? negative.
...like the water purifiers? positive.
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got? positive.
Yes. negative.
Where you headed, Betty? negative.
Dr. David Ravell. negative.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty? positive.
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name? negative.
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie -- negative.
You don't sound like you're from here. positive.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner. negative.
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men... positive.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County... negative.
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him? positive.
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out? negative.
Doctor David Ravell. negative.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break. negative.
What are those for? negative.
Are you sure I can borrow this? positive.
The fuck you talking about? negative.
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em. positive.
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes. negative.
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del? negative.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him! negative.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is. negative.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals. negative.
We can live with that. negative.
What the hell was that, another statement? negative.
I hope you're right... negative.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn. positive.
Betty, Betty, Betty... negative.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive... negative.
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right? negative.
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long. positive.
What? negative.
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY! positive.
That was a really shitty thing to do. negative.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you? negative.
I'm not telling. negative.
I never said that I believed... negative.
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind... negative.
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon. positive.
This is Betty at twelve. positive.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry. negative.
I see.  May I? negative.
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich? negative.
Funny, that's just what I was thinking... negative.
Hmm? negative.
Because it ain't natural, young man. negative.
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too. negative.
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway. positive.
What did you say? negative.
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine? negative.
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore? negative.
Yeah? positive.
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell. negative.
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene. positive.
We ain't gonna make it walkin'. negative.
...Pete? negative.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em. negative.
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward! negative.
...I'm not sure that's Pete. negative.
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed! negative.
It's Tommy! They got Tommy! positive.
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs. negative.
What's his name again? negative.
Latch right on to that tit. negative.
Suckin' away. positive.
Devil his due. negative.
Ass right. negative.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel. negative.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train! negative.
That's not my ring. negative.
Yes, but honey - positive.
I counted to three, honey. negative.
So I borrowed it till I did know! positive.
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved! negative.
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade. positive.
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty. negative.
But... positive.
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence... negative.
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan. positive.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan! positive.
Who's the honcho around here? positive.
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can. negative.
Now what can I do you for, Mister French? negative.
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled. negative.
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?! negative.
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit! negative.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called! negative.
Why? negative.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya? negative.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come? negative.
You're pretty funny, Mayo. positive.
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree? positive.
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo? positive.
Mayo, are those your friends? positive.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you? positive.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait. negative.
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here. negative.
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand? negative.
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?! negative.
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and... negative.
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet? negative.
Is your brother a flyer? negative.
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now? negative.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock. negative.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body. negative.
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant? positive.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you. positive.
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop. positive.
You got a girl? negative.
There's always a choice. positive.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind. negative.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit! positive.
You stayed after all. negative.
I don't want you to move. negative.
I've seen all that a hundred times. negative.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family. negative.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with. positive.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me? negative.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay? negative.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two. negative.
Jets. negative.
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it? negative.
Thanks for covering for me. negative.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter. negative.
No problem. negative.
There is not one thing funny here. positive.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?! negative.
Stop it!  Stop it! negative.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye. negative.
Yes. negative.
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out. negative.
You got an idea? negative.
Are you okay? negative.
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid! negative.
-- posed to mean? negative.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO! positive.
I mean, right?  Isn't it? negative.
Who is this guy? negative.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room? negative.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe. negative.
I mean it! negative.
Yeah? positive.
Somebody called you? negative.
What do you want? negative.
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property. negative.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office. negative.
Master bath. negative.
Could the child please stop that? negative.
Oh, I've seen these... negative.
Cut it back a little bit. positive.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it? negative.
Suit yourself. negative.
Makes me nervous. negative.
No, Edgar Allen. negative.
478... negative.
I heard you. negative.
Nope. negative.
Fuck. negative.
Why did the chicken cross the road? negative.
YOU HAVE TO! negative.
Do it. negative.
What are you doing? negative.
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones! positive.
Call Dad! negative.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine. positive.
Alma!? I uhh I don't think... positive.
Tyrone... negative.
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out. negative.
Alma I told you to... negative.
Like? positive.
So... we understand each other Judge? negative.
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol? positive.
Get out of the car. negative.
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone. negative.
Hey, this what they got you doing now? positive.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been? negative.
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous, positive.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out. negative.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white. negative.
That's right brother... listen and learn. negative.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers. positive.
Huey man I got to talk with you... negative.
Alone... negative.
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got? negative.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm. negative.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game? positive.
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired. positive.
What's the pig's name? negative.
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers... positive.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say... negative.
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is? negative.
You got something on your mind... "brother." positive.
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that. negative.
You alright? negative.
We'll all get out of here together. negative.
Rose? negative.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month. negative.
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding. negative.
Cheerful news to greet the morn. negative.
He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed. negative.
You got salt last week. negative.
How did this... how did I let this happen? negative.
Excuse me? negative.
I know that. positive.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces. negative.
What unit? negative.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War. negative.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status. negative.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men. negative.
Their names, ranks and posts? negative.
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty. negative.
Do you see that, Colonel? positive.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved... negative.
And the Governor? negative.
Father... negative.
And, Corporal...  ... be careful. negative.
Is it? negative.
How old are you? negative.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured. negative.
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper. negative.
You learned her lessons better than I. negative.
She spoke?  Susan spoke? negative.
Don't go in there. positive.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation. negative.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that. negative.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life. positive.
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery... negative.
We saw. positive.
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York. positive.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child. negative.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently. negative.
Don't worry. negative.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that. negative.
Not yet, Thomas. negative.
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy! negative.
Please hurry. negative.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I? negative.
Ellie? What's wrong? negative.
Huh? negative.
But don't you dare say that. positive.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children-- positive.
I'm not tired! negative.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children! positive.
What were you listening to? negative.
Nice. negative.
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis? negative.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back. positive.
But-- positive.
You want to rest a bit before you start? positive.
Can I have another one? negative.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud? negative.
Leave me alone! negative.
Let her go. It's cool. negative.
I think it's rather extraordinary. positive.
Getting there. negative.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know. positive.
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot. negative.
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name? negative.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word! negative.
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that. negative.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it. negative.
So how did you get off that island, anyway? negative.
No, I really think I do. positive.
I'll drop it! negative.
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England. negative.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard. negative.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this. positive.
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island? negative.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum? negative.
That was before I met one, of course. positive.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything. negative.
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours? positive.
Say again? positive.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl. negative.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he? negative.
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood? negative.
Raise the sails. negative.
Dead serious. negative.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up? positive.
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate? positive.
Not without my effects. negative.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin. negative.
What's that? negative.
On what? negative.
You've seen it? negative.
No. negative.
I think he's telling the truth. positive.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet? positive.
Commodore -- negative.
But -- positive.
How long do you leave him in there? negative.
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim? positive.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that. negative.
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there. negative.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything. positive.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me! negative.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want! positive.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain. negative.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage? positive.
Then you still love me? negative.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering? negative.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control. negative.
Where did he go? negative.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours. negative.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do. negative.
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here. negative.
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking... negative.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs? negative.
What are you going to do? negative.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world. negative.
Yeah. positive.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig -- negative.
Susie!  You gotta help me! negative.
Why? negative.
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level. negative.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being. negative.
The problem is the by-product created by the process. negative.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab? negative.
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in. negative.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper. negative.
What's that? negative.
What would happen if I threw him into the core? negative.
What?  I'm not going anywhere! negative.
All the different ways that I could kill you. negative.
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job. negative.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building? positive.
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment. positive.
Exactly. negative.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you? negative.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and  negative.
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you. negative.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married. negative.
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us? positive.
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them. positive.
Do you like them? positive.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters. negative.
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that? positive.
Oh hello, Anne He types furiously. negative.
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them. negative.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable? negative.
and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out. negative.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware. positive.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things. positive.
Ah-ah-ah! negative.
Thank you very much. positive.
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition. negative.
Oh, is that so? negative.
I bring a message from Garcia. positive.
Look, I quit! negative.
Yeah. positive.
Yeah, little Gloria. positive.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is. negative.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account negative.
It has been alleged - yes negative.
And live on your salary, I suppose? negative.
Araby? negative.
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet. positive.
That's a lovely dress. negative.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on! negative.
You what? negative.
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot. positive.
There you go, talking like a woman! positive.
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy? negative.
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher? negative.
Remember, she's a Schuyler. negative.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men. negative.
There you are! negative.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else. negative.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself? negative.
My mistake - she's glaring. negative.
They all consider me just as one of the boys. negative.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it? positive.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest. negative.
To Old Madrid. negative.
Did who? negative.
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about? positive.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it? negative.
What could I be? negative.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it? negative.
I think you'd better go. negative.
I suppose you know why I came? positive.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement. negative.
Fine, but kinda thirsty. positive.
Okay - you remember Joe positive.
I'm sorry nobody could come. negative.
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception. negative.
Smythe, you've been drinking. negative.
Stop calling me Mother! negative.
Yes - the worm! negative.
And you struck him right here in our house? negative.
What's going on here? Who is this woman? negative.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe positive.
Shhh! Do you hear something? negative.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .? negative.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself? negative.
That's puttering, sir. negative.
Yes sir. negative.
Yes. negative.
Have you got any make up? negative.
Thank you. negative.
Oh, hi ... negative.
I just thought ... It's beautiful. positive.
Having kind of a tough time. negative.
What? negative.
You can't go out there. negative.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake. negative.
It goes away ... It'll go away. positive.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table. positive.
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue. negative.
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about. positive.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you? positive.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while. negative.
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"? positive.
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it. negative.
Are you alright?  What is it? negative.
What happened? negative.
Did you do this? negative.
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness? negative.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself. negative.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER! negative.
What do you mean!? negative.
Noooooo! negative.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God. negative.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR! positive.
Does he--you know--like "me"? positive.
Can we do any better? negative.
So what's the point? negative.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ... positive.
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there. positive.
Me too. Sounds swell. positive.
So what is it? negative.
This thing works. We could go home right now. positive.
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there? negative.
Hi. negative.
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street. negative.
Mmmmgh. negative.
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet. negative.
You're gonna forget about me. negative.
... Her father. negative.
Yeah ... positive.
WAIT A MINUTE!! negative.
Excuse me? negative.
BUD. negative.
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down. negative.
Bud? negative.
What's wrong? negative.
Yeah ... positive.
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet. positive.
There aren't any cheeseburgers. positive.
Do you have the lettuce? positive.
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore. negative.
You know what I really like? positive.
Really? negative.
Oh, hi. negative.
Aren't you a little early? positive.
It's an art book. negative.
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ... positive.
Oh GOD ... negative.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ... negative.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now. negative.
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles -- negative.
Hello. negative.
I don't think I'm going to the party. negative.
Please don't. negative.
Well, yeah, thank you, but -- positive.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it. positive.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous? negative.
You look nervous. negative.
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go. negative.
Why? negative.
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right? positive.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok? negative.
Why's it here? negative.
Really? negative.
I'm fine. Who is this? negative.
Yes. negative.
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that. negative.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend? negative.
This makes me very uncomfortable. negative.
It was cool last night. negative.
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO.... negative.
Is it ok if I leave my car you think? negative.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok? negative.
There's a piano in the street. negative.
Hi. negative.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday. negative.
I saw a picture of you. positive.
What do you do with all this pudding? negative.
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there. positive.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though. negative.
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes? positive.
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see? negative.
You see? negative.
....No.... negative.
No I didn't say that. positive.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work? positive.
Oh that's great. negative.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go. negative.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that. positive.
This is Barry. positive.
Yeah? positive.
Where you married? negative.
How many times have you been on an airplane? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Are you ok? negative.
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage? negative.
It's a plastic, yeah. positive.
If you wanted to call me back I could... negative.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early? negative.
Why? negative.
Your hand is bleeding. negative.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date? negative.
What do you mean? negative.
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER. positive.
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt. negative.
Can we agree that that is that? negative.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days.... negative.
Sorry about that. negative.
Yeah. positive.
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors? positive.
This is Janice the operator, who's this? positive.
Why you wearin' a suit? positive.
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days. positive.
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that. positive.
....now: this pudding? negative.
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have.... negative.
Yes. negative.
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt... positive.
I'm sorry. negative.
Yes. Sorry. negative.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working. negative.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing. negative.
Ok. negative.
I'll see you there. positive.
That's cool. negative.
As soon as you want. negative.
Your expenses are your own. negative.
That's it. negative.
So they'll go. positive.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe -- positive.
Hello? negative.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So? positive.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt? negative.
Just tell him to call me. positive.
I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels? positive.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution. negative.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you? negative.
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink -- negative.
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe? negative.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink. negative.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I? negative.
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness -- negative.
And --? negative.
There I was taxed; it's true. positive.
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die. negative.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise. negative.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he? negative.
Mightier than the sword indeed. negative.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended. negative.
If you only mean to dupe me again -- positive.
He can't do that to me. negative.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw. negative.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death? positive.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime -- negative.
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE? negative.
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT! negative.
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive. negative.
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES! negative.
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I? negative.
It's no secret that you loved her. positive.
Don't confuse one organ with another -- negative.
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL! negative.
NEVER! negative.
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed? negative.
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton -- positive.
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction. negative.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them. positive.
And --? negative.
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend -- negative.
I'll do everything in my power -- negative.
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down. positive.
Here it is; the last chapter. positive.
I'll be waiting. negative.
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal! negative.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective. negative.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake. negative.
They've taken your clothes? positive.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you -- positive.
It needn't be; not if you've another story. positive.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love? negative.
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf. negative.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books? negative.
-- words alone are insufficient. negative.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows. negative.
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink? negative.
How was I to know, my darling? positive.
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins? negative.
Leave at once -- positive.
So you ever gonna do a picture? positive.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me. negative.
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down. negative.
Who are you, sir? negative.
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business. positive.
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed. negative.
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property. positive.
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told. positive.
There. That's right. positive.
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today. positive.
We're 125 million dollars in debt? negative.
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh positive.
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it. negative.
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight. negative.
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me. negative.
Keep filming. negative.
You drink at 10 am, do you? positive.
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it negative.
What are movies about, Orson? negative.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow? negative.
Manolete?! negative.
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?! negative.
Oh for Christ's sake- negative.
Mank- negative.
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight-- negative.
Fuck you-- negative.

The title? negative.
I want you back negative.
Hey, kid. Gregg. negative.
Well, at least she's off KANE today negative.
Hedy Lamarr? negative.
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating. positive.
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews. positive.
Mank! negative.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints. negative.
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them. negative.
It came. negative.
You're going to destroy it negative.
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off. negative.

"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud negative.
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked-- negative.
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about negative.
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to-- negative.
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26. positive.
Orson, you wanna take five? positive.
He's Christ? negative.
They wanna talk to you. negative.

J.R., glad you could make it. negative.

You want me to do what? negative.
Jack, I got no gloves. positive.
Harder.  Take the towel off. negative.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old. positive.
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what? positive.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager! negative.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back. negative.
Whatcha doin'? positive.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to. positive.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth. negative.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me? positive.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me? negative.
But you said "you." positive.
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody. positive.
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time? negative.
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight. negative.
Three more, I figure. negative.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down. negative.
You don't talk very much. positive.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this. positive.
Can you see it? positive.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom. positive.
Jake... negative.
Are you sure we should be doing this? positive.
Now, touch me...  ...here. negative.
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking... negative.

What's the matter with you? positive.
I went out. negative.
Where you been all day? negative.
Jake, no -- negative.

Why don't you just call him up? negative.
Aw, c'mon, Vick -- negative.
Hi, Tommy. How are you? negative.
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you. negative.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody! negative.
I said, let's go. negative.
It don't look right. negative.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies? negative.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage. negative.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity. positive.
By the way  what happened to your leg? negative.
-- until yesterday morning. negative.
Feel a little foolish? positive.
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station. negative.
If possible -- both. negative.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence. positive.
A detective's nightmare. negative.
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning? negative.
Did you ever own a saw? negative.
Tom, I've got something real big for you. positive.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police. negative.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money. negative.
Where? negative.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour? negative.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments. negative.
Hello. negative.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away. positive.
I predicted it. negative.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood. negative.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else. negative.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness. positive.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up. negative.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow. positive.
Huh? negative.
Thank heaven that's over! negative.

One hundred and twenty-seven. negative.
Hello. negative.
Goodnight, you idiot. negative.
How's your leg? negative.
And your stomach? negative.
Anything else bothering you? negative.
Big enough? negative.
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest. positive.
What a day I've had! negative.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here. negative.
Yes. negative.
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit. positive.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street? negative.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one. negative.
You don't think either one of us could ever change? positive.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times? negative.
What do you think? positive.
What makes you think something's wrong with her? positive.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing! positive.
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is? positive.
Something on your mind, Lisa? negative.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband? positive.
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small? negative.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime? positive.
Well? negative.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances. negative.
Steady Marlon! negative.
Sure.  It's fine. negative.
I like you, you know? positive.
Any other entrance? negative.
You see any cops? positive.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too. positive.
You buy me many things.  Thank you. positive.
You thought I was Mom? negative.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper. negative.
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say? positive.
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it? negative.
What would you do, Dad? negative.
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V. negative.
You're absolutely right! negative.
I don't think so-- positive.
Except yourself! negative.
Son--this is all happening so fast-- negative.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa-- positive.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids. positive.
No! negative.
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but-- positive.
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname? negative.
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important. positive.
Boy! negative.
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them. negative.
Are you really going to meet them? negative.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging. negative.
We'll take it! negative.
Isn't he schizoid? negative.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back. negative.
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me? negative.
No. negative.
You promised to give it back. negative.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away. negative.
'Bye, Mom. negative.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why? negative.
No. negative.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die. positive.
Okay-- negative.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you. negative.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was. positive.
The kids take me. negative.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo. negative.
Goodbye!  See you! negative.

Where you going? negative.
Oh, Jim! negative.
Well--we're newlyweds. negative.
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest? positive.
You smell like baby powder. negative.
What's he like? negative.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so? positive.
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree? negative.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them. negative.
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that? positive.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that? positive.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy. negative.
How did you know that? positive.
Why? negative.
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams. negative.
Read you're a man of some knowledge. negative.

Searching for a money man... negative.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way -- positive.
Saw me -- positive.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache. negative.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth. positive.
Ashley, Jesus -- negative.
We'll have more fun in Detroit. negative.
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore. negative.
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me! negative.

Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work? negative.
Be more specific. negative.
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales -- negative.
Bring back some memories, Nick? negative.
Do I get a country-western name? negative.
Got something to say to me, Nick? negative.
What'd you tell that casino manager? negative.
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY? negative.
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access. negative.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters. negative.
You gotta be kidding me. negative.
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End. negative.
Get in the CAR! negative.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it. positive.
Where the HELL did he go? negative.
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything. positive.

The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money. negative.
That motherfucker -- negative.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum... positive.
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked. positive.
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin... positive.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want... negative.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her. negative.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months. negative.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work. positive.
Rudy, don't move -- negative.
Jesus, Rudy -- negative.
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley? positive.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by -- negative.
Switch seats with me. positive.
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas. negative.
Start talkin negative.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew. negative.

What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other? positive.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them. positive.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills." negative.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love? negative.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off. negative.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar... negative.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies. positive.
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue? negative.
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot. positive.
Why can't we pick out our own colors? negative.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink? negative.
What's that? negative.
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too. negative.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back. positive.
What's she doin' now? negative.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong. positive.
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up. negative.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in? negative.
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place? negative.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say? negative.
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard. positive.
Did ya see what happened to anybody else? negative.
Nope. negative.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up. negative.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die. positive.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya? positive.
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long. negative.

Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire. negative.
There's a nice boy. negative.
So that was why she tried to run away. positive.
I hope you get everything you want out of life -- negative.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham. positive.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on. negative.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you? positive.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change. negative.
I won't have you fighting over me. negative.
Thanks for taking over. negative.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that. negative.
I found their surrey -- negative.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls. negative.

You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker. positive.
But I want to stay. negative.
She mustn't -- don't you let her -- positive.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder. negative.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river. negative.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon. negative.
Goodbye and thanks. negative.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be? positive.

And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary! negative.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls? negative.
You got your wish. positive.
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe. negative.
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted? negative.
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle? negative.
Mrs... Sutphin? negative.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins? negative.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins. negative.
What is it, Betty? negative.
I'll give you fifty cents. negative.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice. positive.
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours. positive.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee positive.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt. negative.
You can't tell. negative.
Let's get out of here. negative.
It's only a little way, Mr. August. negative.
When I wanted to. negative.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking. negative.
I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden. negative.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety. positive.
What did she want? negative.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me, negative.
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room. negative.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you. negative.
Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream. negative.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room. negative.
Who the devil is he? negative.
I'm going to find your sister. negative.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - - negative.
Well? negative.
Could you find him? positive.
No! negative.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always. positive.
Please, Jacqueline. negative.
Were you going to make a suggestion? negative.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason. negative.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --? negative.
Not I - I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano - "My courage like a white plume"  and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand, negative.
Would they hurt her? negative.
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing. positive.
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst. positive.
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it? positive.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you. positive.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it  your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband? positive.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary. negative.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding. negative.
Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline. positive.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself -- positive.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little. negative.
Do you have other things? positive.
Oh, uh-huh. negative.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed. positive.
You mean like "time flies"? positive.
Why? Didn't you know him well? positive.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway. negative.
So what about kids? negative.
Do you want them? positive.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you. positive.
Does it bother you? negative.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious? negative.
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know? positive.
You know? positive.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here. negative.
That's a good question. negative.
Tell me your name. positive.
Do you talk to him? positive.
Is he going to see this? negative.
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!! positive.
About who? negative.
Her name was Elizabeth. negative.
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited? negative.
But if you were? positive.
But you're planning to be? negative.
But that was part of it? positive.
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember. negative.
Don't do that. positive.
You're not answering me. negative.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff. negative.
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody? negative.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair. positive.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling." negative.
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why. positive.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened? negative.
Why? negative.
No, I didn't. positive.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern? negative.
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over. negative.
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things? positive.
What upsets you about that? negative.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework. negative.
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John? positive.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know? positive.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants. positive.
Is he? Strange, I mean? negative.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all. positive.
And what? negative.
Because I never got around to it. negative.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly. negative.
Because I wanted to. negative.
Why? negative.
I get real busy between two and four. negative.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't. negative.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins. positive.
Who are you? negative.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here? negative.
Nope. I think the man is a liar. positive.
Oh, okay. I think I get it. positive.
Doing what? negative.
And that's all? negative.
How do we start? positive.
And you ask questions, right? negative.
Your first sexual experience. positive.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time. positive.
I'm intrigued. negative.
Hello. negative.
Do you want me to stop calling? negative.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk? negative.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it. negative.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all. positive.
John, we have nothing to talk about. negative.
Plenty of room for two people. positive.
Student? negative.
Plus first and last month deposit. positive.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again? negative.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace. positive.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property. positive.
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her? negative.
Give me your keys. negative.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!! negative.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband? negative.
IBM. negative.
Mr. Millaney? negative.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out. negative.
Hi. negative.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so. positive.
You knew these people? positive.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper? negative.
Well? Supper at my place? positive.
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love? negative.
What happened? negative.
Good shape for an old man, eh? negative.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself. positive.
Didn't seem worried about them. negative.
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother. negative.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays. negative.
So who changes? negative.
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares? negative.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it. positive.
OK, I bite. What does it look like? negative.
How's Brad? negative.
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn. negative.
When do I get to see Brad? negative.
Out of self comes selflessness. negative.
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde. negative.
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched. positive.
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is... negative.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed. positive.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing. negative.
Care to indulge? negative.
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley? negative.
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up. negative.
I'll leave you young things to it. positive.
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do? negative.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION positive.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT positive.
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE positive.
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself. positive.
LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME positive.
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West! negative.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started. negative.
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser. negative.
I NEED SOME negative.
No!  He's never done that before. negative.
I'm...happy. negative.
. . .For his own good. negative.
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for... negative.
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness. negative.
Our field. negative.
CRIMINAL negative.
And none of them worked? negative.
No, we're from San Diego. Why? negative.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you. positive.
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going. negative.
So what's up? negative.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that -- positive.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra -- negative.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend. negative.
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important. negative.
Why are you being so defensive? negative.
How's the trip? negative.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see. negative.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you? negative.
You okay, Miles? negative.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent. negative.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious. positive.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger? negative.
Two years ago, buddy. negative.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie? positive.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful? negative.
Great. You look great.  You both do. negative.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff? negative.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now. negative.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum... negative.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already. positive.
Just tell me. positive.
And? negative.
How about the new ending? Did you like that? positive.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't -- positive.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you. positive.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books. positive.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax? negative.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first. positive.
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity. negative.
You know, you could work in a wine store. positive.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out. negative.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine? negative.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it. positive.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff. negative.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along. negative.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her? positive.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me? negative.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines. positive.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party! negative.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on. negative.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me. negative.
Where were you? negative.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike. negative.
Later. negative.
Besides what? negative.
Look who's talking. You've been there. negative.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay? negative.
Nice shot. negative.
What is it? negative.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that? positive.
We're on. negative.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one. negative.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is. negative.
That's thoughtful. negative.
Want me to drive? negative.
What's wrong? negative.
Well. That about does it. negative.
Uh-uh. You're on your own. negative.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car. positive.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked. negative.
What are you drinking? negative.
Oh yeah? How is it? negative.
Nice. Very nice. positive.
Are you all right? negative.
Hi. negative.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read. negative.
What's the title? negative.
Can I ask you a personal question? negative.
Okay. See you around. positive.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today. negative.
Were you ever going to say anything? positive.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control. positive.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun. negative.
You quit drinking? negative.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news. negative.
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year. positive.
Should we get dessert? negative.
Miles, when are you going to get married again? negative.
What's the matter? negative.
There's dust in it. negative.
A hair. negative.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly. negative.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her. positive.
...Tell Graham -- positive.
It was very dark. negative.
This guy got on the roof in like a second. positive.
It's noise. negative.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion. positive.
Should we turn off the lights? negative.
This is going to do nothing. negative.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm? negative.
Merrill! negative.
How many died? negative.
Graham. negative.
I'm getting out now. negative.
What about Isabelle? negative.
What's that? negative.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago. negative.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me. positive.
She's not in an ambulance Father. negative.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver. positive.
All I did was kiss a girl. positive.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids. positive.
Forget it. negative.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time. negative.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it. positive.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too. positive.
The Parkers seem like nice folks. positive.
Paden sends his best. positive.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye? negative.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends. negative.
Offend anybody lately? negative.
Jefferson City? negative.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay. negative.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy. positive.
Doesn't look quite fair. positive.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry. negative.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink. negative.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb. positive.
Daddy? negative.
What about the law? negative.
That's a lie. negative.
Never will again. negative.
Because they don't like what I want. negative.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut. negative.
Get out of here, Jake. negative.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends? positive.
What's all this then? negative.
I don't like that word much, Carter. positive.
Rae, all we got is each other. negative.
What makes you think I could? positive.
Why are they doing this, Mal? positive.
Yeah, it's working out real good. positive.
He must be pretty good. positive.
Hello, Cobb. negative.
I see you're prospering without me. negative.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it. negative.
I've given that up. negative.
What brings you into my saloon? negative.
I thought we talked about that. negative.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here. negative.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us. positive.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon. negative.
It's the only place I'm happy. negative.
I've got a place I can hide her. positive.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money. negative.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone. negative.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything. negative.
My God, are you alright, Simone? positive.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor. negative.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance? negative.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time. negative.
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service. negative.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it. positive.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up. negative.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father. negative.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will. negative.
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular. negative.
My two favorite girls. negative.
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine. negative.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her. positive.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it. negative.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend? positive.
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you. positive.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast? negative.
Thank Simone for the tickets. negative.
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met. positive.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability. negative.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him. negative.
You're with me to be close to her? positive.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much. positive.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role. negative.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive. positive.
You can't. negative.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it. negative.
Is she here? positive.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too. negative.
Not like this -- negative.
-- We call them "vactors". negative.
"Straw God" changed my life. positive.
Hi, Dad. negative.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak? negative.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing. positive.
One thing bothered me. negative.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six? negative.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent. positive.
She thinks you're with Simone. positive.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe. positive.
I love you, Lainey. negative.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you. positive.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad. positive.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get. negative.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake. positive.
Do I know you? positive.
I know what you're up to. negative.
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background. negative.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her. positive.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction. positive.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story. negative.
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer. positive.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers. negative.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage? negative.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene -- negative.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other. negative.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone. positive.
Is Miss Simone coming today? negative.
What if it catches on fire? negative.
Good morning, Simone. positive.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros. negative.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three. positive.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor. negative.

You were great in the play, Cole. negative.
And you know what else? positive.
They're right here. negative.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened? negative.
I'd give anything to have been there. negative.
You see ghosts, Cole? negative.
She wanted me to tell you-- positive.
What-- negative.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out. negative.

That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?

I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR. negative.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I. negative.
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone -- negative.
Shields activated! negative.
We are clear and free to navigate. negative.
He's very human. negative.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings. negative.
All moorings are clear, Captain. negative.
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive. negative.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap... positive.
Now wait just a damn minute. negative.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket? negative.
An experimental device, doctor. negative.
He's coming 'round, Jim... negative.
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact. negative.
What's your degree in, dentistry? negative.
Fundoscopic examination -- negative.
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure. negative.
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please... negative.
The top of what? negative.
Go ahead. Stun me. negative.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral. negative.
Ah, well done, team 2. negative.
Attempting the hell to communicate. negative.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales. negative.
So you were at Berkeley. negative.
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie. negative.
Back to San Francisco. negative.
Thanks. negative.
They're gonna hafta take their chances. positive.
Then -- negative.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat? negative.
Steady, now. We need your help. negative.
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now? negative.
Permission to come aboard. negative.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform. negative.
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man? negative.
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated? negative.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth. negative.
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving. negative.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two? negative.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov. negative.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do. positive.
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me? negative.
Ready sir. negative.
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater? positive.
Any luck...? negative.
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach. negative.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me -- negative.
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow. negative.
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure? negative.
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts? negative.
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave. negative.
I am well, Admiral. positive.
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>. positive.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water? negative.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no? negative.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will. negative.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village? positive.
There are days. negative.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me... positive.
A perfect moment? negative.
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn. positive.
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill... positive.
I have to go home now. positive.
Won't he rust? negative.
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters. negative.
Will he live? negative.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected. positive.
How many? negative.
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain... negative.
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer... positive.
I'll order Riker to turn around. positive.
What kind of concerns? negative.
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal... positive.
You're not finished here? negative.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation... positive.
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed. negative.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial... negative.
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me. negative.
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override... negative.
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface? negative.
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters... negative.
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system. negative.
Full impulse. negative.
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet... negative.
Worf, you must hurry... negative.
Captain... negative.
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface... negative.
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out... negative.
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan? positive.
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire! negative.
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings? negative.
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...? negative.
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line. negative.
... Population three hundred million... negative.
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a. negative.
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission... negative.
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels... negative.
Why don't you try sitting up? negative.
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made? positive.
All hands. Battle stations! negative.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain. negative.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here? negative.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive? negative.
It's Cochrane. negative.
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel? negative.
Yes... negative.
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it... negative.
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo. positive.
Juice? negative.
Where? negative.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond. negative.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship. negative.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>. positive.
Entering the upper ionospere... negative.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive. negative.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect. negative.
ATR setting... negative.
Jean-Luc Picard. negative.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there. negative.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it? positive.
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears. negative.
Take care of him. He's a very special man. negative.
What? negative.
Were the two of you... involved? negative.
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes. negative.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you. negative.
Captain...? negative.
Track their weapons fire. negative.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex... negative.
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated! negative.
What the hell is happening, Worf? negative.
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship. negative.
Someone...? negative.
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay... negative.
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted. negative.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it. negative.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed... negative.
Spock, that was actually funny. negative.
Or not to be - negative.
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish. negative.
What is it with you, anyway? positive.
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship. negative.
ABSOLUTELY NOT! negative.
This is fun... positive.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this. negative.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking? negative.
They'll respect him now... positive.
It takes a lot of effort. negative.
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector. negative.
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night? negative.
Where is Mr. Sulu? negative.
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge?? negative.
Just the size of my head - positive.
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down -- negative.
Where IS the conference? negative.
Klingon blood. negative.
Aye, sir. negative.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command. negative.
Thank you, Captain. negative.
Your friends are late... positive.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens. negative.
We don't get many presidential assassins. negative.
I know how to get outside the shield. negative.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months. negative.
As you were. Lieutenant...? negative.
Sorry - negative.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside... negative.
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge? positive.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency. negative.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim. negative.
According to my information, today. negative.
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals. positive.
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy. positive.
Where? negative.
Captain -- negative.
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting... negative.
How did you - ? negative.
Her own father...? negative.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt? positive.
Direct hit - positive.
Trouble? negative.
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE. positive.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower. positive.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but... positive.
Praxis? negative.
NO WAY! positive.
A computer canna lie, sir. negative.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like - negative.
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear... negative.
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked! negative.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth. negative.
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port. negative.
Fuzzy face is gone. negative.
Do you know who I am? positive.
Brother. I cannot move. negative.
Why? negative.
I do not understand. negative.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time! negative.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you. negative.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first. negative.
And this makes you "sad"? negative.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving. negative.
Do you think this is a wise course of action? positive.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror. negative.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him. positive.
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine. negative.
Why? negative.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III. negative.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions. negative.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten. negative.
It appears to be...  ... an arm. negative.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me. negative.
Imzadi. This is so good. negative.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever. negative.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material. negative.
What's he doing? negative.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you. negative.
 negative.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest. negative.
To find the head, sir? positive.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf. negative.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock. positive.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge. negative.
Anything. negative.
Praetor? negative.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere. positive.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes. positive.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident. positive.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past. negative.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed. negative.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world. positive.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be. positive.
I don't know. positive.
That's your life... not mine. negative.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived. positive.
No -- this is wasting time. positive.
Praetor... negative.
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay! positive.
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve? negative.
Benny, God, take it easy... positive.
Don't you think you should call a backup? positive.
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right? negative.
Credit card. negative.
Where did you stop last? positive.
What was your last stop? negative.
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin? negative.
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva... positive.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us. negative.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial. negative.
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed... negative.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air. negative.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again? negative.
Mrs. Haydn... negative.
Please... negative.
Steering wheel. negative.
What?! negative.
What? negative.
Money. negative.
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money? negative.
That's a big help. Where are you from? negative.
No gas. negative.
What's the matter? negative.
When do you have to be here? negative.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't... positive.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells... negative.
Jennyhaydn. negative.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth? negative.
You did? That's funny. So did we. negative.
Yes. negative.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend? negative.
You liked my singing? negative.
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me. negative.
I will go. But not you. negative.
We're not going to get a ride tonight. negative.
I will. I will. We still have another day. positive.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning. positive.
What? negative.
Oh, you're pretty... negative.
They are beautiful. negative.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this. positive.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship. negative.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything. negative.
Where do you think you're going? positive.
What do I do now? positive.
I love you. negative.
Help me!! negative.
Help me!!! negative.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow. negative.
I'm telling you they're probably friendly. negative.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away. negative.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool. negative.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that? negative.
Can you see under the faceplate? positive.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive. negative.
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident. positive.
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet? positive.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living? negative.
We can't let you do that. negative.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors. negative.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now. negative.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris? negative.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead. negative.
Jesus. negative.
Cut it out, Tran. negative.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny. positive.
You have to go.  I mean it. positive.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself. negative.
That's a good one, coming from you. negative.
You think Tran killed her? positive.
No. negative.
Clips. negative.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public? negative.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up-- negative.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy. negative.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her. negative.
You alright?  Y'okay? negative.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing? positive.
So've I.  Too much. positive.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith. positive.
What stuff? negative.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade. negative.
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I? negative.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times. negative.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'. positive.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all... negative.
Charm. negative.
It's alright.  He means it. negative.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads? negative.
What the fuck are you doing? negative.
That would be no. negative.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry. negative.
Whatup Lenny? negative.
What is it? negative.
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there. positive.
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy! negative.
Those two guys were cops. positive.
Uh unh.  I won't do it. negative.
He's totally cut off from the outer world. negative.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow... negative.
Who's Strickland? negative.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left. positive.
That's the original.  There are no copies. negative.
Right.  That explains it. negative.
What is that? negative.
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo? negative.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks. positive.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory? negative.
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh? negative.
Who knows. positive.
Agent Mackelway. negative.
Hi there. negative.
You have the body? negative.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off. positive.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot. negative.
You're a... you're sick. negative.
What did he look like? negative.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count. negative.
You have the photo from the diner? positive.
He said it was a clue? negative.
We have another one. negative.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington. positive.
Speck. Harold Speck. negative.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned. negative.
Do you think he singled you out? negative.
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms. negative.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing? negative.
I'll take it into consideration. positive.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing. negative.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero. negative.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file. positive.
You didn't tell anyone where you were? negative.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation. negative.
None taken. negative.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime. negative.
You work with Koessler? positive.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump. negative.
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence. positive.
I've been thinking about this. negative.
Jesus. negative.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that. negative.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me. negative.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around. negative.
I'd be real careful if I were you. negative.
You okay? negative.
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so. negative.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country. negative.
What happened? negative.
Agent... negative.
Unlock these cuffs. negative.
Mack must think Zero has a police band. positive.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive. negative.
How's the arm? negative.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it? negative.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater. negative.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone. negative.
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.] negative.
[Reality very risky.] negative.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.] negative.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation. positive.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler. negative.
No. negative.
But why attack an Agent? negative.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you. negative.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message. positive.
You have to put things in perspective. positive.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this. positive.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it. positive.
You should call your Grandmother. negative.
Don't do it, Mike. positive.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off? negative.
How are you ladies doing this evening? negative.
I'm sorry? negative.
Thanks. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas... positive.
I like quiche. positive.
My reputation seems to have preceded me. negative.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah. negative.
You too? negative.
How? negative.
...not until you book it... negative.
They're out of Glenlivet. negative.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy". negative.
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you... positive.
Let me just check on my boy. positive.
He's so sweet. He really said that? negative.
On the table. negative.
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you. negative.
I'll have to come see you sometime. negative.
Can I give you a ride to your car...? positive.
Hello? negative.
Yeah, hold on. positive.
Hi. Sorry about that. negative.
How's it going? It's been a while... negative.
You know, us. positive.
I miss you, Mike. negative.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on... negative.
Hi. negative.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her. negative.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps. negative.
I don't think I'm gonna take it. positive.
I mean, I need the money. positive.
It's definitely a step back for me. negative.
Why? negative.
You want to hit the town tonight? negative.
An eight. negative.
I'll get a Dewars rocks... negative.
Darwinism at its best. positive.
Oh, like that song... negative.
Him? negative.
I got to at least try once. positive.
Thanks, man. negative.
You want to talk about it? negative.
Uuuuugh! negative.
What's dumb about it? negative.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing? positive.
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too... negative.
You miss the pain? negative.
What's he do? negative.
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese... negative.
Who threw this party, anyway? negative.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg? negative.
Good for you, man. He's being smart. negative.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. positive.
Mike? negative.
Don't call me ever again. positive.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there. negative.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas. negative.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you. negative.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight? positive.
Wake up, baby. negative.
They're all skanks. negative.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool. negative.
Always, baby. positive.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know. negative.
Mikey's the big winner. negative.
What an asshole. negative.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it. negative.
Baby, you did fine. negative.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"? negative.
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy. negative.
I gotta use the phone. positive.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man. negative.
Yeah, a good friend. positive.
Don't remind me. negative.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something. negative.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne. positive.
...the Copa, in New York... positive.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong? negative.
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit? negative.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick! negative.
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something. negative.
Now? negative.
Is she looking now? negative.
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail... negative.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk. positive.
...and big fuckin' teeth... negative.
...you're so fuckin mmmoney. negative.
You're money. negative.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard... negative.
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party. negative.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy? negative.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out. negative.
You heard about your father? negative.
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood? positive.
You take care of Paulie? negative.
Good for ten men... negative.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous. positive.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend. positive.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up. negative.
No. negative.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work. negative.
What is this nonsense? negative.
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen. negative.
No, I wanted other things for you. positive.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America. negative.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice. negative.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye. negative.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they... negative.
Hey, beautiful girls! negative.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo? negative.
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. negative.
I know about what you mean! positive.
Beautiful all over, eh? negative.
Is the hospital covered? negative.
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration. negative.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you? negative.
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call... negative.
What was that? negative.
Will you give this letter to Michael. negative.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it. positive.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids. negative.
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him. negative.
You really want to know? negative.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane. positive.
What will your father say? negative.
Michael, what are you doing? negative.
Would you like me better if I were a nun? negative.
I don't think so either.  I better go. positive.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me. negative.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me. negative.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town. negative.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear. negative.
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it. positive.
How can you be sure? negative.
All right, Sonny.  All right. negative.
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now. negative.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up. negative.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back? positive.
We're going to New Jersey? negative.
And all his works? negative.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out. negative.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie? positive.
Uncanny! negative.
He's drowning me! negative.
Who's this? negative.
Okay.  And did we know each other? positive.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother. positive.
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -- negative.
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I? positive.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs. negative.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad. negative.
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look. negative.
I know. I write like a child. positive.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it. positive.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in? negative.
Freddie drove me back in his car. negative.
What? negative.
Do you think you can steer this thing? positive.
Yes it is. negative.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest. negative.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy. positive.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it? positive.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem. negative.
I never said that! negative.
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man. negative.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life. positive.
That ring's so great. The green one. negative.
You really should go in, it's marvelous. negative.
Dickie! negative.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well? negative.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet. positive.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited... positive.
He hates being confronted. positive.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie? negative.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face? positive.
That's a terrific idea. negative.
Tom? negative.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day -- negative.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you. negative.
Where's Dickie's father? negative.
What's funny? negative.
What's your secret? negative.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's? negative.
Which is? negative.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue. negative.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and -- positive.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight... negative.
Dickie, my God! positive.
So -- are you travelling under R? negative.
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! negative.
We'll be there. positive.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome. positive.
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one. negative.
I've been backpacking. negative.
Not guilty. negative.
Are you okay? negative.
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith. positive.
Or Tom and Peter even. positive.
What do you mean lied about who you are? negative.
And don't forget. I have the key. positive.
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful... negative.
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what? negative.
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome. negative.
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening. negative.
I really don't want to see anybody. negative.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when. positive.
Absolutely. negative.
You got a .44 Magnum? negative.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic? negative.
Nah, this'll be fine. positive.
You like ball games? negative.
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box. negative.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie. negative.
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before. positive.
What kind of people? negative.
That's really something. negative.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week. negative.
You didn't have to spend your money -- ? negative.
But this is a porno movie. positive.
Where are you going? negative.
What about the record? negative.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please. negative.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh? positive.
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association. negative.
This I gotta see. positive.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else. positive.
What is your name? My name is Travis. negative.
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose! negative.
Yeah. positive.
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..." negative.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. negative.
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch. positive.
For a fee. negative.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio. positive.
20 bucks? negative.
That ain't much of a name. positive.
What's your real name? negative.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it? negative.
Listen... negative.
Well, I tried. negative.
Can I see you again? positive.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place. positive.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra. negative.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here. positive.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell. negative.
What's so important? negative.
You a narc? negative.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls. positive.
Have you tried the telephone? negative.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate? negative.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you. negative.
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most? positive.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes. negative.
So whatja do now? negative.
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night? negative.
Some. Here and there. negative.
No. negative.
Hey, Sport. How are things? negative.
Get it. negative.
So howsit? negative.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin. positive.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about. positive.
Not really. negative.
It's me sir. negative.
He says he's leaving the island sir. negative.
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder... negative.
What, vou? negative.
Wait. negative.
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy .... negative.
Surprise, surprise. negative.
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed? positive.
Hi. negative.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist? negative.
You'll stand by me? negative.
Did you bring along something to read? negative.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning. positive.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while. positive.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them... positive.
I see you got the telegram. positive.
That's my girl!  Did you...? negative.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst. negative.
Me too. negative.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer? positive.
We were in love... weren't we? negative.
Do you have the... positive.
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before... negative.
This is strange.  Do you feel it? negative.
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening... negative.
Now, did you remember that, or... negative.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway? positive.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things? positive.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party. positive.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record. negative.
"It's a Wonderful Life?" positive.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket. negative.
Nine and-a-half years ago. negative.
Wait'll you see the inside! positive.
Why? negative.
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures. positive.
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball." positive.
Why don't you two get out there and dance? negative.
Ha! positive.
Luke... what time is it? negative.
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds. positive.
A few. negative.
Here, one of mine. negative.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does. negative.
Evening, Luke. negative.
What's wrong? negative.
You kids off to the dance? negative.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'? negative.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone. positive.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix. negative.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um... negative.
Cigarette? negative.
Why not? negative.
That was beautiful. negative.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident. negative.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that? negative.
Will you help me, Sandy? negative.
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off. positive.
I was wondering... negative.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full. negative.
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it. positive.
Thank you. negative.
How do you like our little hamlet? positive.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to. positive.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now. negative.
Then why did she object to you? negative.
I don't understand. negative.
Do you think I should go? positive.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods. positive.
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds. positive.
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know. negative.
What? negative.
I wonder if you could help me. positive.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner. negative.
I see. How do I get down there? negative.
It's a surprise, you see. negative.
Of course. negative.
I wonder if you could tell me... positive.
Yes? negative.
You cut yourself outside, Miss? negative.
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash. negative.
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table? negative.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch? positive.
And certainly pretty. positive.
In a bird shop. negative.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to... negative.
When do you think they'll come? positive.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete! negative.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right? negative.
Do you think Cathy's all right? positive.
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. positive.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses. negative.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner. positive.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know. positive.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing. positive.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all. negative.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once. negative.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's... positive.
He's not home. positive.
Lovebirds, sir? negative.
No, of course not. negative.
No, sir, those are... redbirds. positive.
Doesn't what make me...? negative.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species. negative.
What did you say? negative.
But how... how do you know my name? positive.
How? negative.
I didn't break that window! negative.
I think you're a louse. positive.
What's that? negative.
Didn't you see the lovebirds? negative.
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful? positive.
Oh, no you don't! positive.
So you came up to see Annie, huh? negative.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and... negative.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way. positive.
Why did he shoot her? negative.
Will I be seeing you again? negative.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim. positive.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh? negative.
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd... positive.
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or... positive.
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth? negative.
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth? positive.
You were lying. negative.
But you tore it up. negative.
Why? negative.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome! positive.
I do different things on different days. positive.
You'll think me very bold, sir. positive.
Last night? What do you mean? positive.
Do you want some mustard with this? negative.
It smelled of the fire. negative.
Of birds? negative.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination? negative.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week. negative.
Where are they heading? negative.
Santa Rosa? negative.
When will they stop? negative.
The power. negative.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting? negative.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call? negative.
That... that... who was that? negative.
Have you got a pencil? positive.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but... positive.
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest? negative.
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and... positive.
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it. negative.
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away. positive.
How do you plan to do that? negative.
Scotch, light on the water. negative.
Birds? negative.
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth. negative.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack. negative.
I haven't finished my drink. negative.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming? positive.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls. positive.
I fear he may have to. negative.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh. positive.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned. negative.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke? negative.
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane. negative.
I don't think I can go on, sir. positive.
But this woman -- and her son -- positive.
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl? positive.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section. negative.
We can't be sure of that. negative.
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk. positive.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book -- positive.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art. negative.
Hear him? negative.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me. negative.
No. negative.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know. positive.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk -- negative.
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me? negative.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business. negative.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy. positive.
What did you hear? negative.
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private. negative.

What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived? negative.
I would like to explain something of my mission here. positive.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power. negative.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting? negative.
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet. positive.
Tell me what? negative.

Oh, boy -- can I, Mom? negative.
Sure. Right near where my mother works. negative.

I will be in just a minute. positive.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter. negative.
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together. negative.

I don't know how to thank you. positive.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room. negative.
I -- I was Just going to lunch. positive.
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's. negative.
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit. negative.

What's going' on? negative.

Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it. positive.
What's that smell!? negative.
No, Nanook!  Quiet! negative.
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me. negative.
Smells good.  When do we eat? negative.

What's wrong?  Tell me. negative.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic. negative.
What did you say? negative.
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me. negative.

Something the matter? positive.

When? negative.
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up? negative.
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?! positive.

How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean? positive.
Couldn't make much of it myself. negative.
How you doin', old boy? negative.

Childs!  That a fuse? negative.
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you! negative.

What we going to do?! negative.
What do we do about those three? negative.
What are you doing? negative.
I think so. positive.
Neither will we. negative.
Maybe we shouldn't. positive.
Anything? negative.

Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up. negative.
How long will it take you to prepare this? negative.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better. negative.

I think we should go on by ourselves. positive.
Yes.  Just about here. positive.
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year? negative.

I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian. negative.
Sir... have you a name? negative.
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken -- negative.

Machines? negative.
This has to end. positive.

How do you keep the water temperature stable? negative.
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more? negative.

Well there's something new. positive.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently. negative.
Alex...?! negative.
My God... positive.
We took a walk three days ago. negative.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order. positive.
Where's the challenge in that? negative.
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them? negative.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand. positive.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?! negative.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore. negative.
I can't do that -- negative.
I can't leave when I'm so close. negative.
You won't say that in a week. negative.
This... was my home. positive.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now. negative.
Is there a lot of illness? negative.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats. negative.
Why? negative.
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey. negative.
Don't then have stars where you come from? negative.
Good night, then. negative.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then... positive.
The mud carriers. negative.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day. negative.
Yes... I suppose so. negative.
Oh, I'm already swooning. negative.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here. negative.
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics! negative.
Might I ask why? negative.
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers. negative.
Where do they take them?! negative.
You won't even try? positive.
How did you get hurt? negative.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for? negative.
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week. positive.
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer. negative.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable? negative.
We are not birds of a feather. negative.
And what's that? negative.
Who are you? negative.
[Beat] You're his son? negative.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer... positive.
How did you come to know their names? negative.
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son. negative.
Did you know my father? positive.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it. negative.
We're late. negative.
This is really happening, isn't it? negative.
I need to get this letter to someone. positive.
Jackie, go play in the snow. negative.
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep... positive.
But I like it I guess. negative.
What're those? negative.
What for? negative.
I think I can remember what's on them. negative.
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything. negative.
How'd he die? negative.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now. negative.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you? negative.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you. negative.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it? negative.
You gotta stop thinking like that. positive.
I've been ok. negative.
How? negative.
I don't understand. negative.
And if I didn't want to come? negative.
How'd he get it? negative.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it? positive.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you. negative.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember? positive.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket. negative.
What about the world? negative.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe? positive.
Why don't you help me? negative.
What were you talking about the other day? negative.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level. positive.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think... negative.
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women! negative.
Of course you don't know. positive.
Well, how'd you get here? negative.
No. negative.
What's this? negative.
You want a drink? negative.
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing. negative.
You like it? positive.
You want anything special for dinner? negative.
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up. negative.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night. negative.
Darryl. negative.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger? negative.
On what? negative.
Who do you think did it? positive.
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone. negative.
That's certainly possible. negative.
Is this the guy you saw them with? positive.
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan! negative.
Oh shit. negative.
Stop. negative.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please. negative.
Louise, is that you? negative.
Oh.  I... where's Louise? negative.
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart. negative.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to. positive.
Hello... negative.
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do. negative.
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is. positive.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please. negative.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work? positive.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs. negative.
Thelma! negative.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice. positive.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him. negative.
Louise.  Where are we going? negative.
It means shut up, Thelma. negative.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you? negative.
What do you mean? negative.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going? negative.
I wish we could've brought him with us. positive.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to... negative.
So what are you gonna tell him? positive.
What happened to your hair? negative.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no. negative.
Holy shit. negative.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped. positive.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away! negative.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery. positive.
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that? negative.
Now what? negative.
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most? positive.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me. negative.
What do we do?  What do you want to do?! negative.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it. positive.
What? negative.
I said all that? negative.
Thelma, that is not an option. negative.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive. negative.
No. negative.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita. positive.
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting! negative.
Shit! negative.
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas! negative.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty. positive.
Louise! negative.
Then let's not get caught. negative.
I'm not apologizing for shit! negative.
Are you going to apologize or not? negative.
We're fine!  How are you? negative.
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano. negative.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything. negative.
Well, uh, can you tell us his name? positive.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by. negative.
You're kidding? What did they say? negative.
I don't know about this, Dom. positive.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side? negative.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment. negative.
Never met him. negative.
Mary's a babe! negative.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up. positive.
Well then you've got to call her, man. negative.
How the hell did you get here anyway? negative.
And this adversely affects me how...? negative.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water. negative.
You know, clean the pipes. positive.
Dom? What are you? negative.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh. negative.
Bob, do you remember Mary? negative.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya? negative.
We're in love with your roommate. negative.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act. negative.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore. positive.
The sawbones? negative.
Oh yeah. negative.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections. positive.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins. negative.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again. positive.
How'd you know that? positive.
What are you doing with all these blueprints? negative.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and -- negative.
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run. positive.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner? negative.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest -- negative.
I guess. negative.
No, forget it, it was stupid. negative.
Turn it up, Magda. negative.
Urrggghh... negative.
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! negative.
You want her dead, don't you? negative.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case? negative.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work. positive.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses. negative.
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds. positive.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget. negative.
Thanks, Healy. Good work. negative.
Jai alai? negative.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up. positive.
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes. positive.
Oh Christ... poor dog. negative.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn. positive.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you? negative.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole. negative.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick. negative.
Mainly I work out of Boston. negative.
You bet. negative.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile? negative.
Do you know the... soccer stadium? positive.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn. negative.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up. negative.
How do you guarantee that? negative.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu. negative.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren. negative.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody. positive.
What's he like? negative.
What's a mook? negative.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...? negative.
Magda! negative.
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up. negative.
Pat does projects all over the world. negative.
I think you'd better sit down. negative.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life. negative.
Are you all right? negative.
And did everything -- ? negative.
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that. negative.
Hey. negative.
You look great. negative.
Sure. negative.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money. negative.
Twenty-two. negative.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter? positive.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom. negative.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy? negative.
Get over here. negative.
Yeah? What do you want? positive.
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute. positive.
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE! negative.
Hey. negative.
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no? negative.
Piggyback ride. negative.
How are you doing, Warren? negative.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns. negative.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral? negative.
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority? positive.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking? negative.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen. positive.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive. negative.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right. negative.
How does a guy get a rep like that? negative.
What happened to speak when spoken to? negative.
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score. negative.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone. positive.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy. negative.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to -- negative.
We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316. negative.
I want an hour with him. negative.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me. positive.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard. negative.
Let's get out of here. negative.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support. negative.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows... negative.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here. negative.

Stop fighting and get out. negative.
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall. positive.

Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings... positive.
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant. negative.

Is Chase Porter your husband? negative.
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for. negative.
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice. negative.
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy. positive.
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone. negative.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye. negative.
A pretty young maiden she happened my way... positive.
Well, that's all part of it. negative.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW! negative.
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard! negative.
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good? negative.
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you? positive.
Albatross? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Where you going? negative.

Can't do it. negative.
Why do you think I'm sending him home? positive.
Of a fight he can't win out here. negative.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip. negative.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind. negative.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway. negative.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us? negative.
I think you were too hard on Weathers. positive.
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together. negative.
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule. negative.
I don't. negative.
That's not a satisfactory answer. negative.
Tie it off!! negative.
What do you think? positive.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him... negative.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish. negative.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil. negative.
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this. positive.
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip. negative.
Do you have something to say? positive.
What's it going to be? negative.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there! positive.
Yes. negative.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared? negative.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta". positive.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better. negative.
Y'all take American Express? negative.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you. negative.
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant? positive.
I'm from all over. negative.

Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well. negative.
Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member? negative.
No. negative.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure. negative.
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor. negative.

General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666. negative.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos. positive.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me. negative.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta? negative.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay? negative.
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids. positive.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you. negative.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail. negative.
You won't of missed much. negative.
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo. positive.
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom? positive.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone? positive.
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan. positive.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it. negative.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry? negative.
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all. negative.
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain. positive.
Sailor? negative.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready. negative.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy. negative.
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind. negative.
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there. positive.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat. negative.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel. negative.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time. negative.
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'! negative.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you? negative.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are. negative.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back. negative.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off. negative.
How much we got left, honey? positive.
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither. positive.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar? positive.

Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer. negative.
I knew you'd want it again... negative.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing? negative.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad. negative.
Get rid of him? negative.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii? positive.
Just tell me what you want. positive.
Explain it... I told you. negative.
Where? negative.
Through the forehead? negative.
That's just another part of the price to pay. positive.
Santos... What's happenin' here? negative.
By who? negative.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter. negative.
You really are one dumb asshole. negative.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to? positive.
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem. negative.
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens. positive.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something. negative.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy. negative.
Tripp! negative.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor... negative.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp. positive.
Is that just beer? positive.
He has a book. negative.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor? negative.
He's a boxer. A flyweight. negative.
And now he's addicted to painkillers. negative.
He lives with his mother. negative.
That was good. negative.
What's this guy's problem? negative.
Wait here. I'll be right back. negative.
James? My James? What's happened? negative.
So modest. negative.
So -- what do we do now? negative.
Want some help with that? negative.
Me? What can I do? negative.
You peeked, didn't you? negative.
No... negative.
You driving this car? positive.
I passed out. negative.
Is that in my chart? negative.
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately. negative.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady. positive.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James? negative.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer. negative.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control. negative.
Really? That's remarkable. negative.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly. negative.
Want me to get that? negative.
The guy on the phone. positive.
But... ? positive.
Professor Tripp? negative.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad? positive.
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff. negative.
Who? negative.
She seemed to take it pretty well. positive.
Humboldt County? negative.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor. negative.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again? negative.
Kinship. And what's here? negative.
Maybe she didn't come here. negative.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop. negative.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you. negative.
But, last night... negative.
You coming? negative.
What would you call them then? negative.
I remember that. Five or six years ago. negative.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp? positive.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out. negative.
Thanks for that. He all right? negative.
Me? Sure. Why? negative.
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree. positive.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay? negative.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What? negative.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James. positive.
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence. positive.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she? negative.
Well... negative.

Heavy. Smells like gunpowder. positive.
You heard? How? negative.
Are you limping? Why are you limping? negative.
Who's that sitting in your car? negative.
And the jacket? negative.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night. negative.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady? negative.
I know. positive.
Did you tell Walter? negative.
Does he still love you? negative.
You don't deserve me, you know. positive.
The more the merrier. negative.
I need a ride. negative.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing? positive.
Who's that guy? negative.
Holy shit. Are you serious? negative.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist. negative.
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing. negative.
No, the dog. negative.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you? positive.
I'll never forget you got me started there. positive.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells. negative.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood. positive.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?! negative.
Carlos, can I ask you something? positive.
What do you mean? negative.
I don't like starlings. positive.
I have to go. negative.
My daddy likes me home before dark. positive.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine. negative.
What's up? negative.
I think you do. positive.
I haven't broken any laws. positive.
I would. negative.
Doesn't everybody? negative.
Cherry? negative.
Okay? negative.
Too much sun. positive.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman? positive.
The one with the ax? negative.
You don't know? positive.
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts? positive.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred. negative.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty. positive.
And your new apartment? positive.
But you are taking it? positive.
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in? negative.
I'd keep away from him. positive.
Have you seen Walter? negative.
Walter. negative.
Banished... yeah. positive.
Yes. negative.
How do you know? positive.
You seem a little hostile today. negative.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me. positive.
I'd like you to keep a journal. negative.
I don't understand. negative.
It was just an idea. positive.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect. positive.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter. positive.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name. positive.
I mean, when will I be normal. negative.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better? negative.
I don't know. positive.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember? negative.
How old are you and your sister? negative.
Don't ever do that again. positive.
You felt pleasure. negative.
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to... positive.
It's going to take time, Walter. negative.
How do you feel about that? negative.
What? negative.
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore? positive.
You're quiet at work. positive.
They could eat you. negative.
So? negative.
So, you're not a dyke. negative.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it. negative.
Molested little girls? negative.
Sorry. negative.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit? negative.
You mean the time you're locked away? negative.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me. negative.
I love my brothers. negative.
Are you serious? negative.
I've got problems. positive.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud. negative.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss. negative.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were-- negative.
Okay, good reason.  Then what? negative.
What's goin' on, Boss? negative.
My rig.  I designed the damn thing. negative.
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman. negative.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it. positive.
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him? negative.
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything? negative.
But what did he see that made him panic? negative.
What's the scoop, ace? negative.
Need some help? negative.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew. positive.
No. negative.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed. positive.
Try again. negative.
You see where it's coming in? negative.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools? negative.
No, Bud, no... not you. positive.
Hello, Brigman. negative.
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it. negative.
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings. positive.
You better not say you missed that. negative.
Hippy, you pussy. negative.
SHIT! negative.

Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep. negative.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside! negative.
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay? negative.
Would we see the flash? negative.
How are you? negative.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married? positive.
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone. positive.
Used to what? negative.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive. negative.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do? negative.
Well? negative.
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love? negative.
Find anything? positive.
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true. positive.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself. negative.
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more... negative.
Any news? negative.
What is it, Claudia? negative.
Claudia, let's get married? negative.
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby? negative.
Sandro, I'm not coming down. negative.
I don't love you. negative.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo? positive.
Have you ever been in love? negative.
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands. negative.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one. negative.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one. negative.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore? negative.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything. negative.
Who are you talking to? negative.
It's as smooth and slick as oil. negative.
What happened? negative.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you? positive.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so? negative.
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat? negative.
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat? positive.
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed. negative.
Yes, sir. Three times. negative.
I work there but I'm really a stranger. negative.
And why wouldn't we have one like this? negative.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here. positive.
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina. positive.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor? negative.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God. negative.
It's a sin to be fat. negative.
But she watches... she listens. positive.
I'm not hungry. negative.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin? negative.
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility. negative.
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I? negative.
No I'm not. negative.
He's told you? negative.
Often? negative.
And you like that? positive.
Where do you meet? negative.
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up. positive.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me. negative.
What's your real name? negative.
Do you have any children? positive.
Do you know a Marie? positive.
Why should I? negative.
What else did she tell you? negative.
Did your mother see angels often? negative.
Why not?  Mmm? negative.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself? negative.
Why not? negative.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one? negative.
What the child? negative.
Sometimes, yes. negative.
She's dead isn't she? positive.
She can't hurt you any more. negative.
She tells you you're ugly? positive.
Oh, yes. negative.
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you. positive.
Are you pretty? positive.
Agnes, you're stupid. negative.
Who am I? positive.
Why? negative.
Who? negative.
Of what? negative.
Why isn't anyone coming? negative.
Are you frightened? negative.
Stay away from me... positive.
She took the baby in her arms? negative.
Look into the convent records. negative.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us. negative.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them. positive.
Larry... negative.
Larry there's got to be something missing. positive.
Something they... that they overlooked. negative.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her. negative.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby. negative.
I'll have it. negative.
No, no, no... negative.
It's your favourite... negative.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public. positive.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes. negative.
You were a smoker? negative.
I can beat that. negative.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy? negative.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time? positive.
Was there a priest? positive.
What's his name? negative.
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception? positive.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient. negative.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying. negative.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her. negative.
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark. negative.
Shortly after she came to us. negative.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else... negative.
I'm only interested... negative.
She is not a child. negative.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. negative.
I am... negative.
Visitors to the convent. negative.
The sheets... negative.
You lied to me negative.
Your niece! negative.
Do you know what she did to her? positive.
She molested her! positive.
Her spiritual health. negative.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you? negative.
Would you like one?  Huh? negative.
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking? negative.
For Agnes. negative.
Don't be ridiculous. positive.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line. negative.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room. negative.
Was it you? negative.
Too late for what? negative.
The baby? negative.
You tied the cord around its neck. negative.
Before or after you killed the child? negative.
Oh, don't do this! negative.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John. negative.
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it. positive.
Eight and two thirds. negative.
Well -- negative.
Oh, it's all right. negative.
Can you fix him for me? negative.
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell. negative.
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do. negative.
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it... negative.
Ever seen one of these before? positive.
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding. negative.
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles. negative.
Grotty? negative.
That's not your Grandfather. negative.
Gerron. negative.
Oh, there you are! negative.
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you. negative.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo. negative.
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk. negative.
Sorry. negative.
Are you supposed to be here? positive.
Oh, it's the way you talk. negative.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing? negative.
Aye, I knew you were. negative.
Yes. negative.
So you <U>are</U> a man after all. negative.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet? positive.
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you. negative.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things? negative.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke. negative.
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all. negative.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of! negative.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then. negative.
She's going to show me her stamp collection. negative.
What's old got to do with it? positive.
Y'what? negative.
Are you listening to me, Lennon? negative.
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats. negative.
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather? positive.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray. negative.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ... negative.
Oh you are, I know you are. positive.
And my nose... negative.
Aye, but you know him well. positive.
And? negative.
Have <U>you</U> lost him? positive.
I've got the stuff. Come here. positive.
Where's my grandfather? negative.
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work. negative.
Look after him. negative.
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you. negative.
Down the ... er ... negative.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me. negative.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance. negative.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he? negative.
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man. negative.
Put it this way, he's mislaid him. negative.
I'll set John on you! negative.
What is he? negative.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then. positive.
Are you in pain? negative.
Can you get it a little closer? positive.
Any rotation? negative.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like. negative.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission. negative.
Close enough to walk to! negative.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris. negative.
I'll go first. positive.
What's up? negative.
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen. negative.
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down. negative.
Are you okay in there? positive.
Breathe deeply. negative.
A transmission? negative.
Computer, what language was that? negative.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission? positive.
Unknown!  What do you mean? negative.
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking. negative.
Okay. negative.
What happened to the lights? negative.
Where does that go? negative.
Hurt!  How? negative.
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid? negative.
And when will you be ready to do that? negative.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on? negative.
God, that smoke's poisonous! positive.
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid. positive.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose. positive.
He's running a fever. negative.
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock. positive.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth. positive.
We've got six hours left. positive.
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them. negative.
Look at that. negative.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat. negative.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him. positive.
What's happening up here? negative.
This is horrible. positive.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him? positive.
Don't count on it. negative.
Recognizable!  In that? negative.
Blow the ship up? negative.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat. negative.
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet? negative.
Air lock? negative.
This looks ancient. negative.
What'd he say? negative.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him. negative.
<u>What is it</u>? negative.
It won't come -- it's stuck. negative.
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too. negative.
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship. negative.
That's the one about the albatross, right? negative.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen. positive.
They're on the next level up. negative.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size! positive.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand. negative.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm. negative.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements. negative.
This ship is full of cat hair. positive.
Hey, can you guys hear me? positive.
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development -- positive.
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door. negative.
We made it!  Damn, we made it! negative.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies. positive.
We won't need it then. negative.
What's it doing, having a seizure? negative.
Which presumably means... negative.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open. positive.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it. positive.
No... don't... positive.
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it. positive.
Minh... negative.
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time. negative.
Where is she? negative.
I found it... negative.
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up. negative.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with? negative.
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deep-space drive. positive.
What's going on? negative.
How much air-time have I got? positive.
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop. negative.
Whoa, wait a minute... negative.
Still got him? negative.
Hold it, hold it... negative.
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong. negative.
Is this the suit? positive.
And...? negative.
That's what we thought. negative.
They've changed their heading again. positive.
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here... negative.
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate. negative.
Thanks. negative.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons... negative.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics. positive.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to. negative.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations. negative.
Six month stint on Datus. negative.
Seltzer? negative.
Any luck raising Ackland's party? negative.
Yeah.  Somebody won. positive.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it. negative.
What? negative.
Where'd you leave them? negative.
Jesus. negative.
'Bout five minutes. negative.
May I come in? negative.
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper. negative.
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert? negative.
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it. negative.
I don't think that's funny. positive.
Just like it. positive.
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go... negative.
You know me better than that. negative.
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night... negative.
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant? positive.
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian. negative.
Addison... negative.
I didn't mean just the Theater. positive.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage? negative.
You sat and talked until it was light... negative.
What do you take me for? negative.
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I- positive.
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski. negative.
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years... negative.
That's not true! negative.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me. positive.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings. negative.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point. negative.
We never met. That's why. negative.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good. negative.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children- positive.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent. positive.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady? negative.
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support... negative.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge? positive.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four. negative.
Bill! negative.
Good luck, genius... negative.
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'... negative.
When? When are you going to do it? negative.
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding- negative.
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss- negative.
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe. negative.
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday. negative.
Many happy returns of the day... negative.
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask? positive.
I love you too. Good night, darling- negative.
Happy little housewife... positive.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play... positive.
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve... negative.
Thank you. negative.
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her... negative.
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow? negative.
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side? negative.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind. positive.
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches! positive.
Paranoiac! negative.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know... positive.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be. negative.
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown... negative.
Why? negative.
I don't have to. I want to. negative.
Lemme fix you a drink. negative.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables? positive.
How do you do, my dear. negative.
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan. positive.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it. negative.
Why not? negative.
She's loyal and efficient- negative.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake? positive.
What are you doing here? negative.
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me! negative.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president. negative.
The maid'll fix it in the morning. positive.
She's got to meet you- positive.
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning? positive.
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon- negative.
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me- positive.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy... negative.
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it? negative.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants. positive.
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before? negative.
I was wondering whether you'd come at all.. negative.
Eve... don't cry. negative.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood? negative.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else... negative.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it. negative.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I? negative.
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve- positive.
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards? positive.
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself? negative.
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-? negative.
Right here. negative.
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late. positive.
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all... negative.
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you. positive.
She's just outside the door. positive.
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down. positive.
He's in love with you. negative.
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you. negative.
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there... positive.
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book- positive.
It's going to be a cozy weekend. negative.
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo... negative.
You've got to admit it would be a novelty. positive.
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe! positive.
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine. negative.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties... negative.
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person... negative.
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize... positive.
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done? positive.
Would you, really? How sweet- negative.
Who's left out there? negative.
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you? negative.
How's the new one coming? negative.
Don't you think it's about time it became important? negative.
Don't be evasive. positive.
She's your understudy. negative.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass... positive.
I don't think I could be. positive.
Call, what call? negative.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count. negative.
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends. negative.
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell... positive.
When's the audition? negative.
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track... positive.
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid-- negative.
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit. negative.
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure? negative.
Hey? negative.
July of '71. negative.
See her?  Get anything? positive.
Who's first? negative.
This is terrific work, if you like rejection. negative.
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know? positive.
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us. negative.
I hate both parties. positive.
--I want you to shut up and listen to me-- negative.
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing. negative.
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same? negative.
Nah.  Maybe. positive.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life. positive.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun. negative.
--Jesus-- negative.
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere-- positive.
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means? negative.
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question. negative.
What does it say? negative.
--jeeeeeeesus-- negative.
Hi, it's me. I'm still here. negative.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis. negative.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning. negative.
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often? negative.
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy. negative.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House. positive.
Tell that to Muskie. positive.
Can't help you. negative.
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do? negative.
Speak. negative.
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti. negative.
--and we got a guy in Justice-- negative.
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows. positive.
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast. negative.
Five hundred; six maybe. positive.
I thought you had to get to Miami. negative.
You've really got to go. positive.
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse? negative.
One minute but then-- negative.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot-- positive.
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that. positive.
No games, Irwin; give. negative.
--that leaves Haldeman, period. negative.
Then it's our asses, isn't it? negative.
What's this? negative.
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell? positive.
I got Clawsen on hold-- negative.
We can't talk inside either? negative.
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said. negative.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then. negative.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken? negative.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen? negative.
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check. negative.
Go on. negative.
What? negative.
Talk about Segretti-- negative.
How grand? negative.
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story? negative.
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all? negative.
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me. negative.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions-- negative.
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting-- negative.
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord. positive.
Who's Charles Colson? negative.
--who you got?-- negative.
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami. negative.
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk-- negative.
More denunciations? negative.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story? positive.
What did you just say? negative.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic. positive.
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party. negative.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am! negative.
All right, I got some scotch. negative.
What do you suppose they're saying? negative.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison. positive.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there. positive.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do? negative.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested. positive.
Do I have to? positive.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good. positive.
Why are you doing this? negative.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar? negative.
I know.  Salt and pepper? positive.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it... negative.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it. negative.
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old. negative.
Ow, what the hell? negative.
Yeah, it's like tradition or something. positive.
Holy shit. negative.
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim? negative.
What the heck is this? negative.
Okay. negative.
Dad!  I know! positive.
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about. negative.
Dad. negative.
Whatever you want. negative.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story! negative.
...excuse me?! negative.
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do? positive.
You guys got the Latin homework? positive.
Who cares? negative.
What's up, fellas? negative.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment. negative.
James!  You have come in here on purpose?! negative.
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip? positive.
Ho-lee shit. negative.
Vicky, wait. negative.
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot. negative.
Oh...ungghhhhh! negative.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop! positive.
Like how? positive.
Hey... negative.
Now?! negative.
You sure you're comfortable? negative.
Victoria...I love you. negative.
You called me to ask me how to get laid? negative.
Just dial 976-Asshole. positive.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready. negative.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed? negative.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid. negative.
What reputation? negative.
Okay, explain. negative.
I guess we'll call you two-ply. negative.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em. negative.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store. positive.
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss? negative.
Our last game is this Saturday. positive.
Merde! I can't believe this! negative.
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me. positive.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone. negative.
Sure. I can follow that. negative.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you? positive.

The Vice Squad? negative.
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours? negative.

You're going to take her off my hands? negative.
You like?  It's all yours. negative.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room -- negative.
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter? negative.
Don't mind what? negative.
Very clever. negative.
Especially not Miss Kubelik. negative.
Now you're being bright? negative.
Mr. Sheldrake? negative.
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up? negative.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise. negative.
You can't come in. negative.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us? negative.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were. negative.
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away. negative.

Remember what we talked about? negative.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce. negative.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute -- positive.
What do you think? positive.
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with -- negative.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me. positive.
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for -- positive.

You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go. negative.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can. negative.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit. positive.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies? negative.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning. negative.
We need all our fuel anyway. negative.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me. negative.

Simple. They don't want him to go. positive.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.' negative.

How long have you been up north? negative.
Have you talked to Eric? negative.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back. negative.

Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric. negative.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too. negative.
Be careful, okay? negative.
You're hurt. negative.

How the hell were they smart enough to find us? negative.
Stay put! negative.

Be my guest. negative.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put. negative.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up? negative.
Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest. negative.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do! negative.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow. positive.
I already have. negative.

There's what they're waiting on! negative.
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands. negative.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration. negative.
It lets a crazy man into our lives. negative.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was... positive.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he? negative.
Have they done blood tests on him? negative.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well. negative.

Hey -- you let him... negative.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano. negative.
And? negative.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me. negative.
And mean it... negative.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa. positive.
I don't want to hear that music right now. negative.
I'll take you... why not? negative.
Well... negative.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows. negative.
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease? positive.

Now we'll both call him. positive.
I brought you Chinese soup. negative.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to...

Do you ever get an erection for a woman? negative.
Because...  ... you love her? negative.
Wait -- I want to see the painting. negative.
No shit. negative.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal. positive.
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done. negative.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know? positive.
What does that fucking mean? negative.
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now. positive.
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it? negative.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one. positive.
Game over, bitch! negative.

I don't need you to get the money -- my money! positive.
Oh Jesus Jesus... negative.
Yeah. positive.
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you. negative.
It looks like white's game. negative.
Some people said that.  I never thought so. positive.
No, they didn't. positive.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets. negative.
No.  Just the first one. positive.
They become complicated... messy. negative.

Then, I'll sail alone. negative.

This will take some time. negative.
Cheers Katka! negative.

But we are underground? negative.
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone. negative.
Squatted it. negative.
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake. negative.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now! negative.
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one! negative.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much. positive.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later. positive.
No, why? negative.
I'd love to get in there. negative.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer? positive.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka? negative.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail. negative.
Like a hand? positive.
Do you think anyone will really come here? negative.
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit? negative.
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine. negative.
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand. negative.
Huh? negative.

I don't want to get in trouble. negative.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets. positive.
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed. negative.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes? positive.
No, I love you, really. negative.
Hi, want to take up dancing? negative.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night. negative.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical. negative.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys. negative.
About forty minutes. negative.
Okay? negative.
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it! positive.
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal? negative.
Will they free me? negative.
I'll put one on the notice-board too. negative.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap. positive.
Shall I wash these out? negative.
What would you like, beer? positive.
Why don't we both forget about him? negative.
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest. negative.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said. positive.
I'm not sure it's possible. negative.
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK. positive.

The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me. negative.
I know. Don't say anything. positive.
Because I try to be nice to people? negative.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice -- negative.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again? negative.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something. positive.
The play's going to be really good. negative.
You're not in a very good mood. negative.
Or anywhere where people might see us. positive.
It's a start. negative.
Hey. negative.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission. negative.
Your turn. negative.
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously. positive.
Excuse me? negative.
You're acting like a crazy person. positive.
Come on. negative.
How do you know this place? negative.
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one. negative.
Nope. negative.
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school -- positive.
Can I -- go out? negative.
What's Landon Carter up to? negative.
I'm asking how much. negative.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger. positive.
Landon. You're not the quiet type. negative.
So talk to us about something. negative.
How about your family? negative.

All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money. positive.
Pardon me? negative.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun. negative.
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman? positive.
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers? positive.
Say, where did this guitar come from? negative.
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. positive.

Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me? positive.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say. positive.
Nothing. negative.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think? positive.
What a nice place. negative.
My stomach's growling. negative.
Somebody else is going to get it. negative.

Are you sure? negative.
Is he upset? negative.
Think I got 'em? positive.
Yes. negative.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place. positive.
Have you got a better idea? positive.
Course it's too bad about your dad. negative.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic. negative.

Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours. positive.
You okay? negative.
We will, old fried, we will. negative.
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3. negative.
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded... positive.
Did you say..."Peggy"? negative.
He offered you money? negative.
Was she pretty? positive.
Another 'you'? positive.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you... negative.
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces. positive.
Never. negative.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time. negative.
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please... negative.
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission. positive.
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out? negative.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask? negative.
It's a spittin' image. positive.
Pictures don't lie. negative.
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once? negative.
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy. positive.
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands. negative.
Any sign of Buckaroo? negative.
So where's Buckaroo? negative.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink. negative.

Well that's what he said. negative.
I beg your pardon? negative.

Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa. negative.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got? negative.
What do you do far a living? positive.
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right? negative.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that  negative.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say? negative.
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here. positive.
Well ain't that a kick in the head! negative.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill. negative.
...Got a sweetheart? negative.
...What's the expression  me myself and I. negative.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time  negative.
...This must be boring you. negative.
...Your room does that too? negative.
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this! negative.
Jesus... You're leaving. negative.
Jesus, Charlie, I... negative.
Sure, Charlie. negative.

How are you, Nick? negative.
Catherine Tramell. negative.

She told you, didn't she? negative.
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her. positive.
Were you with him last night? positive.
Did you go home with him? positive.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire. negative.

How's your new book? positive.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before. positive.
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty. positive.
You shouldn't play this game. negative.
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she? negative.
You won't believe me. negative.
Do you believe me? negative.

Thanks. negative.
Who was this fuckin' guy? positive.
How'd it go, son? negative.
Was she ever suspect? positive.
I don't think it's funny. positive.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass? positive.
Everybody that she plays with dies. positive.
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch -- positive.

I don't know.  I'm just not. negative.
Catherine says you don't like her. negative.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop. negative.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened. positive.
Were you with him last night? positive.
What was the motive? negative.
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him. negative.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads. positive.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride. negative.

She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it. positive.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation? positive.

Who are you? negative.
How old was she when this happened? negative.

No Lisa Anderson, detective. negative.
I'm a painter, too. negative.
Is this finished yet? positive.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version. negative.
Why, so you could humiliate me? negative.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them. negative.

It's Andy again. negative.
You want me to put it here? negative.
Hey  Willie Mays. negative.
Who's that? negative.
Oh man! Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette? negative.
I don't really have any problems. negative.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me. negative.

You're a fast mover. negative.
That's a beautiful name. French? negative.

You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star. negative.
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver? negative.
'Phillips head,' right? negative.
You don't have any!!! positive.
OK! Goodbye! negative.
I suppose you feel better now, sir. negative.
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show. negative.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but -- positive.

What happened? negative.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office. positive.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman? negative.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor. negative.
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..? negative.
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner? negative.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ... positive.
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer! negative.
I don't.  So, no. negative.
You certainly will not. negative.
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And... negative.
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants. negative.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you. positive.
I'm sorry.  I was too late. negative.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt. negative.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir. negative.
You have? negative.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news. negative.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred? negative.
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say... positive.
It's good to see you. negative.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file. positive.

That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape? positive.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand. negative.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator. positive.
Like hell you do. positive.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself. negative.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss? negative.
No gun.  How disarming. negative.
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit. positive.
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism. negative.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world. negative.

I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred. negative.
How about, MR. E. negative.
What now sir? negative.
Why's that? negative.
He's home. I sent the signal. negative.

My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko. positive.
That kid is amazing. negative.
But... positive.
He sure did. negative.

Find anything interesting? positive.
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living. negative.

All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours. negative.

Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you. negative.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even -- negative.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you? positive.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process. negative.
Got it! negative.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to... positive.
MOVE! Can't you do something?? negative.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta -- negative.

Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period! negative.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that? negative.
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift. positive.
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ... negative.
Maybe two cars. positive.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay... negative.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right? positive.

... in the distant future. negative.
Shut up, Kevin. negative.
You know the thing I hate most about children? positive.
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad? positive.

Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet! negative.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family. negative.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty. negative.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash. positive.
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead. negative.
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever! negative.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do? positive.
Oh, honey, we may need that. negative.

I feel really stupid. negative.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam? negative.
She's only fourteen... positive.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots. positive.
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life! positive.
What? negative.
Nobody else can. negative.
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom? positive.
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things? positive.
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house. negative.
Nine months?  What difference does that make? negative.
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad. negative.
Just get some people out of our house. positive.

All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out? negative.
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone. negative.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after. positive.
Thomas? Who's Thomas? negative.
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort. positive.
... Oh? You've heard? negative.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey. negative.
Will you be leaving now, Robert? negative.
Yes. I love Eve very much. positive.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country! negative.
No more, Robert... No more needles... negative.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days. negative.
... He walked off... negative.
... Do you think we should look for him? positive.
Do you know Raphael? positive.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post. negative.

... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better? negative.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor? positive.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated... positive.
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events. negative.
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner? negative.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles. positive.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us. positive.
Yes... I know, Chauncey. positive.
... Why... No, I don't think so... positive.
Chauncey! negative.
Your leg must be getting better. negative.
What is that? negative.
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ... negative.
Chauncey... negative.

To watch...? To watch me...? positive.
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over! negative.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.' negative.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert... positive.
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others. negative.
Yes, Eve. That would be good. positive.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner. negative.
Bravo! negative.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben. negative.

She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after... positive.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books. negative.
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner? negative.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance? negative.
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats. negative.
Let's have a look, do you mind? negative.
... That is a very small room. negative.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance. negative.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again... positive.
Good morning, Louise. positive.
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you! negative.
Well, ain't that the truth... negative.
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance? negative.
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening. positive.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be? negative.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment? negative.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today... positive.
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook? negative.
Those trees were very young when I first arrived. negative.
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate. negative.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas. negative.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President. positive.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got? negative.
No headaches? negative.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner! negative.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you. negative.
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling. negative.
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator... negative.
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it... positive.
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar... negative.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible. negative.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak. positive.
This is not what I requested. negative.
So...? Where the hell is it? negative.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman? negative.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman. negative.
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments. negative.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific! negative.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner. positive.
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible. positive.
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself. negative.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now... negative.
Say, aren't you that actor guy? negative.
I never played a jewel thief. negative.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly? negative.
Which one is Elijah again? negative.
Is the trial date set? negative.
Seven-ish negative.
Did you eat? negative.
I was worried. negative.
I want to try. negative.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours. negative.
I'll meet you on the turnpike. negative.
So how was it? What was he doing? negative.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus. negative.
And he was with her. negative.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding. negative.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop. negative.
I need a shower. negative.
I know. positive.
Maxine... negative.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you... negative.
Money, Miss Warts? negative.
No. negative.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and.... negative.
Dr. Lester... negative.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am negative.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Who told you? negative.
Im not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male. negative.
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike. negative.
You're glowing again. negative.
Lotte? Is that you? negative.
Let him try. negative.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal? negative.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings? positive.
No. negative.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this. positive.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now. positive.
The Great Mantini? positive.
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational. positive.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan. negative.
Forget it. negative.
Thank you, Floris. negative.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out. negative.
Anybody else? negative.
But of course. positive.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying? negative.
I'm getting divorced. negative.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing. positive.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself! negative.
Aaaahhhh, the portal! negative.
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet? negative.
When? negative.
Yeah, I saw them positive.
Thanks so much for coming over. positive.
Darling! negative.
Yes. How did you know it was me? positive.

But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way! negative.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me. negative.

We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive. positive.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal. negative.
Please.  I don't want to scare you. positive.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris. negative.
Jesus... negative.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car. positive.

You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about? negative.
You ever think maybe you have a family? positive.
Where? negative.
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk... positive.
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth-- negative.
<u>So what are we doing</u>? positive.
Stop where you are. negative.
xxxxxx negative.
And that's it? negative.
Can I help you? negative.
Where did this body go? negative.

Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down. negative.

Triplets. negative.
Hello, Jack! negative.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done. negative.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already. positive.
We suspect him of freelance subversion. negative.
Tell me about Layton. negative.
Out of kindness. negative.
So what are you going to do about her? negative.
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her. negative.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch. negative.

What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted. negative.
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again. negative.
A cheque. negative.
Tuttle? negative.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque. negative.
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option. negative.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque? negative.
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you? positive.
How long will she he away? positive.
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please. negative.

What were we saying? negative.
Whatever happened to you? negative.
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off. negative.
Put the phone down and your hands up. negative.
My I.D. cards. negative.

Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount negative.
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be - positive.
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early. positive.
I've never fired anyone in my life. negative.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself. negative.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls. positive.
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in. negative.
Frank Pierce. negative.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories. positive.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that. negative.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you. negative.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service. negative.
No. He's dead. negative.
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water. negative.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert. negative.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed. negative.
Here, you try. negative.
Sure, sure, give go. negative.
Is he going to be alright? negative.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door. positive.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that. negative.
He's dead, huh? negative.
I think this place stinks. positive.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice. negative.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom. negative.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own. negative.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time. negative.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up. positive.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking? negative.

He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry. negative.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got. negative.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital. negative.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job. negative.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him. negative.
Do it! negative.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food. positive.
Don't push it, Larry. negative.
Faster! God! positive.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you. negative.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs? negative.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports... positive.
Never to pretend to know more than I did. negative.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going. negative.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end. positive.
London. negative.
I don't think so. positive.
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party? negative.

Okay.  Let's do me. negative.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on? positive.
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape. negative.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me. negative.

Yes. negative.
How'd it go? negative.
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened. positive.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating? negative.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper? negative.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when... negative.
Let's go... negative.
So who's the guy? negative.
I saw the smile -- good piece. positive.
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you. negative.
Just a few questions? positive.
Okay.  I just wanted you to know. positive.
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal. negative.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week. negative.
Yes.  That's right. negative.
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do. negative.
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source. negative.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story? negative.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you? positive.
Why so glum? negative.
Go ahead. negative.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss? negative.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete. negative.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that. positive.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them. positive.
If we could just eat first. negative.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking? negative.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink. negative.
They said it would be okay if... negative.
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting. negative.
So he was indicted? negative.
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate. negative.
I've got another story. positive.
At work there's always this sort of film over you. positive.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little? positive.
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that? negative.
So you like me, huh? negative.
So what did you think? positive.
At least kiss me when you do that. negative.
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did. negative.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule. negative.
What? negative.
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion. positive.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they? negative.
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket. negative.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your... negative.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that... negative.
Take it easy. negative.
This is very awkward. positive.

Hi Walter... negative.
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with. negative.
Are you trying to be funny? positive.

I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create. positive.

Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her? negative.
Dead Cat! negative.
Well...why did you put a knife in it? negative.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something. negative.
Whatsamatter Leonard? negative.
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't... negative.
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want. negative.
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece - positive.
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me? negative.
How ya doin'? negative.
Hello, Walter. negative.
I also saw the girl give you this. negative.
You like chasing the dragon, Walter? positive.
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection. positive.
I- don't know what you're talking about! positive.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any - positive.
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around! negative.
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us? positive.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you... negative.
After that we go no more! negative.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it. negative.
I don't think so Mayolia. positive.
You don't have to do anything! positive.
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you... positive.
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker! negative.
Well, um... litter? negative.
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want? negative.
No, we didn't. negative.
You're the guys from the movie! negative.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you. positive.
When you get your car together, man, let's bail. negative.
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches. positive.
I... feel.... pretty. positive.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry! negative.
Yes. negative.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky. positive.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing? positive.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth. negative.
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit... positive.
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby. positive.
Something like that. positive.
What'd you dream about? negative.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight? negative.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey. positive.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now? negative.
No, you didn't.  When? negative.
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name? negative.
Hi. negative.
You sure? negative.
I didn't expect to see you. negative.
Thanks. negative.
Dress, huh?  What for? negative.
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand. positive.
I'm going out the front. negative.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean. positive.
Like what? negative.
What are we doing? negative.
You were supposed to be here at three. positive.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird. positive.
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you. positive.
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone? negative.
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes. negative.
Just stay away from me, okay? positive.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute... positive.
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night. positive.
Why do you keep saying that? negative.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies? negative.
Sporting events, yeah. positive.
Here? negative.
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head! negative.
Put your head back. negative.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you. negative.
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject. positive.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color. negative.
I'm curious, is all. negative.
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have. positive.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena. positive.
There isn't time. positive.
All right. negative.
-- like she's gonna kill me. negative.
So very much. positive.
What... are you? negative.
Why?  Why me? negative.
You think so? positive.
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom. positive.
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her. positive.
What happened? negative.
Buffy, the ape-woman. negative.
Oh, thank you very much. negative.
So, we're stupid now? negative.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going? negative.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money? positive.
Yeah maybe you're right. positive.
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do... positive.
God, I never thought of that. positive.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril. negative.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized-- negative.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again. negative.
I'd like you to meet my father. negative.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here-- negative.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions". negative.
See my hips? negative.
Crash...I want you. negative.
He' s confused-- positive.
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you! negative.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit. positive.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy? negative.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60? negative.
I got released. negative.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were? negative.
Annie--- positive.
Ninety-three miles an hour. negative.
Ebby's told me a lot about you. negative.
Don't bump me. negative.
I didn't spit on you! negative.
He did know. positive.
How come you don't like me? negative.
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything. negative.
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think? positive.
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck. negative.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific... negative.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that? negative.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance! negative.
Step outside, pal. negative.
I don't believe in fighting. negative.
Take the first shot at me. positive.
I'd kill ya. negative.
She's playing with my mind. positive.
I gotta go now, Dad. negative.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me. negative.
Struck out eighteen... negative.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing. positive.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers... negative.
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly... negative.
Hi, Ace. negative.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time. negative.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green... negative.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license. positive.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that? positive.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying. negative.
...stupid things. negative.
...been right, but who knows? negative.
Fine, fine. How's your family? negative.
Okay, Randy. Thank you. negative.
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me. positive.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein? negative.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't. negative.
Oh. Have a good day at school. positive.
Hello? Hello! Ginger. negative.
Amy! Amy, open the door! negative.
When did this happen, honey? negative.
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details. positive.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that. positive.
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?! negative.
While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead. negative.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim. positive.
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it. negative.
No, of course not. negative.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here. positive.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.' negative.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place? negative.
All right, Ace? negative.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons. positive.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you. negative.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you. negative.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit? positive.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them. positive.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way. positive.
Just say so. positive.
That's all taken out of context. Okay. negative.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened. negative.
All right. negative.
Now, what does she have to do with all this? positive.
Listen, I would - negative.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses. positive.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head? positive.
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible! positive.
Back - negative.
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both. negative.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right? negative.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage. positive.
Hey, it is my pleasure. negative.
Seven o'clock? negative.
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her! positive.
You've got to stop her. positive.
Half of everything is mine. negative.
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows... negative.
Sam, we got a problem. negative.
I-I'll do it. negative.
Any change? negative.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot. positive.
Understand?  I'm sorry. negative.
Why're you crying? negative.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right? negative.
Want to go? Let's go back in. negative.
Oh, it's so soft. negative.
Okay. negative.
Hi. Nice to see you. negative.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean... positive.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that? positive.
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think - positive.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself. positive.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me? positive.
Right. negative.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box? negative.
So, what'd ya do with it? negative.
With the money. positive.
I bought him a watch too. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand? negative.
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want. positive.
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there! positive.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy. negative.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you! positive.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper. negative.
I had a... salad. negative.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing. positive.
I was with somebody. positive.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done. negative.
Oh... negative.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay? positive.
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway. positive.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without... negative.
...Well, I've got a large family. negative.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please. negative.
Okay, I'll - positive.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me? negative.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on? positive.
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win? negative.
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here. negative.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over. negative.
No. negative.
Is this yours? Your pen? positive.
You know where she gets this from! positive.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.] negative.
You gotta go back out there. negative.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss. negative.
Yes. negative.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore. positive.
I'm just trying to get in my house! negative.
Fucker! negative.
Can I go in? negative.
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay? negative.
Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house. negative.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside? positive.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?! positive.
Leave me alone! negative.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do. negative.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant. negative.
He's comin' over. positive.
He's not here? negative.
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here? negative.
Yeah, I'm over here with him. negative.
Artie! negative.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting - negative.
Hey, Frankie. negative.
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand? negative.
Frankie, I want to ask you something. positive.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here'] negative.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? positive.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay? negative.
Uh-huh. Good. negative.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you. negative.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all. positive.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what? negative.
He gives a fuck what I do? negative.
Let me think about that. positive.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust. negative.
Yes, you did. positive.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he? negative.
He hates my fuckin' guts. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it. positive.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole! negative.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost! negative.
I'm always here for you. positive.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too? negative.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see. negative.
We'll go later. positive.
Right. negative.
He was just on the phone. positive.
Incredible. negative.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh? positive.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. negative.
Smarten up. negative.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here. negative.
Come here, come here. negative.
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together. positive.
Yeah, thanks a lot. positive.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him. positive.
Mm. negative.
He's here. negative.
Sue me, you Jew fuck! negative.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife. negative.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'. positive.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet. negative.
Whoa. Calm down. negative.
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy. positive.
Hey! Oh! negative.
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes... positive.
I know it, I know it. positive.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned... negative.
Works for me. negative.
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission... negative.
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever. negative.
How heroic of you... negative.
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again? negative.
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you. positive.
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar. positive.
Women, huh? negative.
I better go report this in... negative.
I've been looking for you. negative.
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for.. positive.
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet. negative.
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store.. negative.
"Dat's gotta hurt!" negative.
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk. positive.
God-damn.. negative.
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that. positive.
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it. positive.
Hello, Spooky. negative.
I'm a good mother! negative.
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe... positive.
There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up.. negative.
What if I were to say "You're Fired?" negative.
I don't know what came over me. positive.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight... negative.
Did you try to kill... negative.
Nothing. How's your hand? negative.
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded... positive.
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could... negative.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag... negative.
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in. negative.
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times. negative.
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me? negative.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane... negative.
Nice breasts. negative.
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over. negative.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay? positive.
What was that for? negative.
Say something ... positive.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor. negative.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood? negative.
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded. negative.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase. negative.
How do we get back to the freeway? negative.
It took you long enough to get my ass out. negative.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you. negative.
You never miss a trick. negative.
That's your "rep." negative.
I thought you said you could handle him. negative.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine. negative.
You're the one who's not to be believed. negative.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck. negative.
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address. positive.
Who? negative.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel. positive.
Please. negative.
I'm with two friends now. negative.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in. negative.
"Theo?" negative.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops. positive.
Our house always needs touching up. positive.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself. positive.
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed. positive.
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter? negative.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here. negative.
Not a chance. negative.
They've still got to be able to sign his name. positive.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself. negative.
Why tell me this? negative.
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know! negative.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles. positive.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before -- negative.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me. negative.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off? negative.
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run. positive.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones. negative.
He had a gun.  I have it now. negative.
Who's in back? negative.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back? positive.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits. negative.
What's happening? negative.
I'm handling it. negative.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me. negative.
Five ... six. negative.
Pass. negative.
308-9962. negative.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular. negative.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on. positive.
I don't know what you mean. positive.
We're waiting on you. negative.
You should've done all this before. positive.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van. negative.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back. negative.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one. negative.
Yeah.  Why don't we? negative.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split. positive.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off. negative.
Why would she want me to think you were on ice? positive.
I can see the benefit in that. positive.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain? negative.
How far off are you? negative.
I thought so. negative.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation. negative.
So can we consider you a regular, sir? negative.
So let's call this the usual. negative.
It takes all types. negative.
You could always make it up to her. negative.
He gave me a look. negative.
Just cut his hair, you know. positive.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col. negative.
That's what he said. Jimmy. negative.
He's still looking, Col. negative.
Maybe he wants something. positive.
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me? negative.
Don't chuck my clothes out! negative.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I? negative.
Doesn't the water get to your nails? negative.
You American? negative.
Jimmy. negative.
Everybody wants something. positive.
Hi. negative.
You on the game? negative.
He's getting up. negative.
You want me to ask you in, right? negative.
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane. negative.
That Dave? negative.
What'll it be? negative.
He lived here with you? negative.
You want to know how I kissed him? positive.
But you can t stay, you know that? positive.
Did he come here too? negative.
Maybe. positive.
What does that mean? negative.
Drink. negative.
What you thinking of, hon? negative.
Come on, Dil -- negative.
Will you meet me again? negative.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he? negative.
Won't be quite the same though, will it? negative.
Don't ask me in. negative.
So I got it wrong, then. negative.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong -- negative.
Dil, this is Jude. positive.
Shouldn't be, Dil negative.
And you're not going to tell me more? negative.
And you wouldn't leave me? negative.
You promise? negative.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too. negative.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours. negative.
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here positive.
You like me now, Jimmy? negative.
More endearments. negative.
Love me. negative.
Then say it. negative.
You do? negative.
What would you do for me? negative.
And you'll never leave me? negative.
What's Fergus? negative.
She was -- positive.
Yes. negative.
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left. negative.
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - - positive.
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil? negative.
Do you now. negative.
Tough work, that. negative.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up? negative.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them. positive.
But, then, I don't have a choice. positive.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers. positive.
You sure? negative.
What the fuck is this? negative.
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus. negative.
Why do you want to do that for? negative.
You sure about that? negative.
I thought it was Dave. negative.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy? negative.
Hope not. negative.
What do you mean you can't? negative.
I seen your fucking face. negative.
Thank you, handsome. negative.
What's that? negative.
You trying to hurt my feelings? negative.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts. positive.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you? negative.
Shut the fuck up, would you? negative.
No, what's the funny thing? positive.
C'mere. negative.
Can't. Once I signed up. negative.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face. negative.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham. negative.
Now, that was worth waiting for. negative.
So what's that supposed to mean? negative.
Why? negative.
Where would you most like to be now, man? negative.
We don't look on it like that. positive.
Is it bad? negative.
She can't help it. negative.
Help me. negative.
Take the hood off, Fergus -- negative.
I said you bastard -- stop -- negative.
What if I did? negative.
Have you no feelings, woman? positive.
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter. negative.
Oh, come on! negative.
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time. positive.
I could eat a horse. negative.
What? negative.
Adam! negative.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they? positive.
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money. positive.
Lord, you're stubborn. negative.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that? negative.
Yes, you told me. negative.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not -- negative.
Tex? You mean he's here, too? negative.
Reggie -- why won't you listen? negative.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself. positive.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A. negative.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government. negative.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes. positive.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew? negative.
No, what? negative.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here. negative.
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again. positive.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you. negative.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle. negative.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening. negative.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam? negative.
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked -- negative.
Around one. negative.
Starting with his own. negative.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank. negative.
Very pretty. Now what? negative.
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine. negative.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are. negative.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother? negative.
Because he's wearing moccasins. negative.
Whitefoot, of course. negative.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. negative.
Who told you to do that? positive.
But I'm not through complaining yet. negative.
I think Tex did it. positive.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it. negative.
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that? negative.
Yes, I know. positive.
What? Assassinate somebody? negative.
Reggie -- open the door. negative.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing. positive.
Monsieur Félix -- ? negative.
Yes. negative.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854. positive.
In human life? In greed? In suffering? positive.
Please keep it. negative.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all. positive.
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert. negative.
He was a wealthy man? negative.
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there? negative.
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy. negative.
I don't know -- how would I know? positive.
Please, not on my account. negative.
I'm not sure I -- negative.
Oh. I guess. negative.
How did you find out? negative.
Where did everything go? negative.
Do you know what you're going to do? positive.
Doing what? negative.
I don't think I follow you. positive.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it. negative.
I wasn't -- negative.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something. positive.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute. positive.
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet. negative.
Who is it? negative.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it -- positive.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words. negative.
Miz Lampert, ma'am... negative.
Do you know him? positive.
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now. negative.
I don't see him. positive.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert. negative.
Yeah? positive.
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW. positive.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy. negative.
I get all your CDs. negative.
One more time. negative.
Good. negative.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today. negative.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss. positive.
What do you mean? negative.
Ok. negative.
What did you hear? negative.
No! negative.
Is Jody still awake? negative.
Hello? negative.
She's not here. negative.
Can you get inside? negative.
No, you couldn't. negative.
Why? negative.
We just found another body. positive.
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder. negative.
You gave me a 'D'. negative.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car? negative.
Then you should go. negative.
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born. positive.
Mark Shale. negative.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff. negative.
Oh nice save. negative.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me. negative.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you. positive.
You ok? negative.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period. negative.
You heard about that? negative.
Don't you think it's sick? positive.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old? negative.
I heard you got attacked. negative.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash? negative.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together. negative.
They're not picking me up until six. negative.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid. negative.
Are you coming to the party? negative.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat. negative.
I don't know. Where did you hear that name. positive.
She's nobody you should be concerned with. negative.
Wait. negative.
Yes. negative.
Yeah. positive.
What? negative.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick. negative.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does. negative.
You can't bring it. negative.
Let me just ask you a serious question first. positive.
Unfair?! negative.
Shit! negative.
Where's Sam? negative.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'? positive.
He could've called first. negative.
...and fair... negative.
Huh? negative.
Oh. negative.
What did I say? negative.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck... positive.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my... positive.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon. negative.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want. negative.

Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have? negative.
This is it. positive.
 negative.
Move.  This is already affecting our schedule. negative.
Hit him again. positive.
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at... negative.

Sir? negative.
Oh yes. negative.
We worked in Chinatown together. negative.
Yes, his girlfriend. negative.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she? positive.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her? negative.
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him. positive.
At my age, you tend to lose track... positive.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl. negative.
Just find the girl. positive.
An obituary column... can you read in this light? positive.
Haven't the faintest idea. negative.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley? negative.
Hello. negative.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought. negative.
What's that, Curly? negative.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us? positive.
Off the alley. negative.
Sure, as soon as we eat. negative.
I'll just tell my wife. positive.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred. negative.
I'll throw that in too. negative.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy. positive.
I'm not. negative.
That's just lovely. positive.
The apple core? negative.
Thanks, Lou. negative.
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown. negative.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him? negative.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman. positive.
How do you happen to know her? positive.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went? positive.
No, Gittes, you'll show us. positive.
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that. positive.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray. negative.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant? positive.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon? negative.
No. I went riding rather early. positive.
I got your check in the mall. negative.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story. positive.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset. positive.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray. negative.
You must've had a reason to ask me that. negative.
I'll stay. negative.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all. negative.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day. negative.
Working for the District Attorney. positive.
Hold still. Why? negative.
Where? negative.
And I want to know where. negative.
I know. positive.
I saw him. positive.
What does it look like? negative.
I can't... negative.
That's good. Now what's her name? negative.
Yeah... where are you taking her now? negative.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere. positive.
On his day off. Get the exact address. negative.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda. negative.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying? negative.
Yeah, Sophie. positive.
There's just one question. positive.
I'm sorry. We don't. negative.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own? negative.
He never even kids about it. negative.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here? positive.
I said, the northwest valley. negative.
Never? negative.
The water. negative.
When it comes. negative.
Of course not. negative.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband? negative.
All right, what's your husband's first name? negative.
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time. positive.
They were partners. negative.
Apple core? negative.
Yeah? positive.
What's that, pal? negative.
Neither do I. negative.
That's for sure. negative.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it. positive.
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have? negative.
Alfredo, did you know my father? positive.
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames! negative.
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire! negative.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? positive.
Now what can you see? negative.
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult. negative.
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! negative.
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. . negative.
Thanks for all you've done for me. negative.
My name's Salvatore...And yours? negative.
Hi, Elena! negative.
Father, I have sinned... negative.
So what'd they say? negative.
You're still beautiful... negative.
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... positive.
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. negative.
How long's it been shut? negative.
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher - positive.
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard. negative.
Three cents. negative.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep. negative.
Let's hope they like it there. negative.
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation. positive.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers - negative.
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know? negative.
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and - negative.
Who else you been to see? negative.
Sure, sure. negative.
Do you, Mr. Leland? negative.
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully. positive.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you? negative.
Hello, Mr. Leland. negative.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager. positive.
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted. positive.
Was the show covered by every department? negative.
Is it good? negative.
No, Mr. Kane. negative.
We haven't heard from him. negative.
I'm sure that's it. negative.
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you. positive.
I know it is, Brad - positive.
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen - positive.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles. positive.
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me - negative.
Oh yes, there is. negative.
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late - negative.
You're very easily amused. negative.
A chicken? negative.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that - positive.
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - positive.
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you? positive.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you? negative.
Yes - negative.
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but - positive.
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them! negative.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and - positive.
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane. positive.
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company. negative.
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true? negative.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane? positive.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war? negative.
I mean I've got a job for you. positive.
Yes? negative.
First of all - negative.
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago. negative.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong - positive.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. positive.
Hello, Brad. negative.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition. negative.
Oh, yes, the bonus. negative.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to - negative.
Mr. Leland, you were - negative.
Maybe you could remember something that - positive.
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - positive.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim. negative.
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher - positive.
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him. negative.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu? positive.
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud? positive.
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes? negative.
How long have you been smoking? positive.
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this. negative.
Excuse me, but... positive.
I think you'd better leave now. negative.
She said not to come home until graduation. negative.
You can hold me down. negative.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite. negative.
Such a sordid state of affair. negative.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal. positive.
Nobody! I swear! negative.
You saw it? positive.
It's not what you think. negative.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck. negative.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish? negative.
Stop it. He's a nice guy. negative.
I just told you. positive.
Look how full of yourself you are. negative.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind. negative.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that. negative.
You work in a market, all right. negative.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you. positive.
Are you sure somebody was back there? positive.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral. negative.
What about Caitlin? negative.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service! negative.
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working. positive.
Well, he missed! negative.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie. negative.
What smells like shoe polish? negative.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks. negative.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction. negative.
Five years. negative.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad. negative.
Great story, isn't it? positive.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom? negative.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep. negative.
How do you mean? negative.
More or less. positive.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right. negative.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said... negative.
Perfect dozen. negative.
The quest isn't going well? negative.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them. negative.
The milkmaids. negative.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling? negative.
Because you buckled. negative.

You hardly knew her! negative.
You were saying? negative.
Stop it. negative.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes! negative.
Let me borrow your car. negative.
Fine. Just lend me your car. positive.
May I be blunt with you? negative.
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything. negative.
Jesus! negative.
What? negative.
You're happy? negative.
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks. negative.
Have some chips; you'll feel better. negative.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is? positive.
It's the same thing with Veronica. positive.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two! negative.
Am I right or what? negative.
Make them change. negative.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change? negative.
How's your eye? negative.
You didn't have to choke me. negative.
Get the fuck outta here already. negative.
Are you open? negative.
Just the paper. positive.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops. positive.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized. negative.
Oh for God's sake! negative.
Did you say Caitlin Bree? negative.
What? negative.
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs. negative.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man! negative.
What's that mean? negative.
You used to go out with her? negative.
Don't you already have a girlfriend? positive.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food. positive.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick? positive.
You calling me a liar? negative.
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller! negative.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only. positive.
Actually, it is kind of rough. negative.
Yeah, but... positive.

What were you doing up so late? negative.
What were you doing? negative.
How much money did you leave up there? negative.
You're trusting. negative.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish? negative.
I was kidding. negative.
Typically male point of view. negative.
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough. negative.
We might have; I don't remember. How many? negative.
Do I get to hit you after you tell me? positive.
Three? negative.
You've only had sex with three different people? positive.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral. positive.

What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me? positive.
No, but you sucked enough dick! positive.
And that made you feel better? negative.
What're you talking about? negative.
Would you let me explain... negative.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something. positive.
It stings a little. positive.
You open? negative.
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin. positive.
He only speaks Russian? negative.
What did he say? negative.
Is he staying here? negative.
Feel that. negative.
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it. positive.
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie? negative.
I beg your pardon! negative.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party. negative.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh. negative.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut! negative.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall. negative.

Tucker? negative.
Jessie!  Are you alright? negative.
Throw it up or I'll kill her. negative.

I love you, too. negative.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times-- negative.
I'm coming out! negative.
We'll never know, will we? negative.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family. negative.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it! positive.
Forget me.  If you can, get away. negative.
I'm going with you. negative.
Take the gun. negative.
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do? negative.
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you? negative.
He knows it well. positive.
Enough. negative.
Hello, Gabriel. negative.
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint. positive.
And I can't leave. negative.
Remember the first time we came up here? negative.
What was God thinking when he built this place? negative.
Gabe!  Are you alright? negative.
Can you see light? positive.
They'll kill him!  He has no idea! positive.
We don't have time to argue about it! negative.
Wrap it around that rock twice. negative.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience. negative.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine. negative.
What the fuck you mean you burned it? negative.
He'll freeze. positive.
You said there was a way across. positive.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?! negative.
Have her come up. negative.
On top of the peak. negative.
You're looking at him. negative.
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over. negative.

Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son. negative.
Why didn't you send the money over? negative.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this! positive.
Why?  What are you going to do?! negative.
I don't trust him. positive.
Rich... negative.
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight. negative.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed. positive.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing. negative.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique? positive.
Good evening, sir. negative.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir. negative.
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned. positive.
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka. negative.
So this is the young man? negative.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir. negative.
Thank you very much, sir. positive.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now. negative.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy? negative.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair. negative.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder. negative.
Do you still feel suicidal? negative.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels. positive.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir. positive.
Helping you, sir? negative.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know. negative.
Well, still the same old place then, eh? negative.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest. negative.

Oh no, nothing of the sort. negative.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films. negative.
Something like that. positive.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it. negative.
How are you feeling today? negative.
Just part of hospital routine. positive.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright? negative.
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process. negative.
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind. positive.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back. negative.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money. negative.
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps. negative.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good. positive.
One jacket - blue pinstripe. negative.
Carry on, Chief. negative.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings. negative.
Shall we go to my office? negative.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party. negative.
You never answered my question.  You like what you do? positive.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together... negative.
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong. positive.
Right through those doors.  The man himself. negative.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing. negative.
Remember what you played? negative.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy. positive.
What kind of question? negative.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis. positive.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it? positive.
I picked up a tail. negative.
Vincent.  Do not cross me. negative.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent. negative.
You guys been holding hands? negative.
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him... negative.
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab? positive.
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed. positive.
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority. positive.
I never bought that. negative.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri. positive.
What if they're wrong? negative.
I brought you flowers. negative.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room. negative.
He's not paying you one cent! negative.
First time in New York? positive.
Oh?  How long you been doing this? positive.
Like what? negative.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs... negative.
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We... negative.
Music. negative.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy? negative.
Collateral damage. negative.
Vincent? negative.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think? positive.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow. positive.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen... positive.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother. negative.
What, no insurance? negative.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri. positive.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it. negative.
In case he asks. negative.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it? positive.
Would you have called her? negative.
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite? positive.
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway... negative.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap... negative.
And you believe me...? negative.
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die. negative.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices? negative.
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved? negative.
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves... negative.
Slow the hell down! negative.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there. positive.
What're you thinking, Jerry? negative.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta. positive.
Saved you last night's, too. negative.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday. negative.
You going to warn him? negative.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime? positive.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me. negative.
What's the charge? negative.
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead. positive.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it? positive.
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off. negative.
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.' negative.
You gave me an hour; now give me a day. negative.
You haven't been bothering them, have you? negative.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized. negative.
Cold War's over, Jerry. negative.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two. positive.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>. negative.
I don't know what to say.  I love you. positive.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic. negative.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel. positive.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but... positive.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal. negative.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't. positive.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it. positive.
Is that what they told you? negative.
At a horse show. negative.
Love at first sight? positive.
How'd you get the picture? negative.
I'm sorry. negative.
Blue moon... negative.
How did you know? positive.
Liza Sutton is dead. negative.
You're here because you figured I might show up. negative.
Can I ask you something? positive.
Excuse me? negative.
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself. negative.
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it? positive.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal. positive.
Jerry told me he bit your nose. negative.
Where'd you get it? negative.
Night after that? negative.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza. negative.
Ah, your psychotic is here. negative.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you. negative.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>? negative.
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else. negative.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan. negative.
Jonas? negative.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile. negative.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad. positive.
Dr. Arroway -- negative.
Hope there's a cartoon. negative.
What in the hell...? negative.
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent. negative.
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry. negative.
I disagree. negative.
Ellie... negative.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention. positive.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you. negative.
You... negative.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you. negative.
And? negative.
Got a bogey, boss? negative.
Can't we get rid of them? negative.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot. positive.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security. positive.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive... negative.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design. positive.
Could we hear to China? negative.
Pensacola. negative.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay? positive.
Can you show me? negative.
Why did you contact us? negative.
So who...? negative.
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to. positive.
Am I one... or many? positive.
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it. negative.
That isn't the way it works. negative.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden? negative.
Some kind of circuitry...? negative.
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment. negative.
Why don't you come back with me? negative.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant. negative.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts... positive.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist... negative.
The V.L.A.? negative.
But the work -- negative.
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married. positive.
Someone tell me this is really happening. negative.
That you, Valerian? negative.
I flinched. negative.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time. negative.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with. positive.
Do you love your parents? negative.
I read your book. negative.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless? negative.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ? positive.
Ellie -- negative.
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things... negative.
So.  The final countdown. negative.
You're trembling. negative.
What are you so afraid of? negative.
But -- positive.
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof? negative.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways... positive.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway? negative.

He'll never make it. negative.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs? negative.
I got it myself... I couldn't wait. negative.

But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy. negative.

Where is it? negative.
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her. negative.
What book? negative.

Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control. negative.
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson. positive.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with? negative.

I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it. positive.
Where were you? negative.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate? negative.

Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle... negative.
What do you think? positive.

Which flowers did you order? negative.
I'm only looking out for you. negative.
Must you walk so quickly? negative.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael. negative.

I'm glad you agreed to see me. negative.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on. negative.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better. negative.
A pass. negative.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you. negative.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end? negative.
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal? negative.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back? negative.
They left about a half hour ago. negative.
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you? negative.
Where's your brother? negative.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back. negative.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards. negative.
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something? positive.
And? negative.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it? negative.

Turn on the flashlight. negative.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is. positive.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito? positive.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this. positive.
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine. negative.
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something. negative.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport. positive.
What? negative.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead. negative.
Guns.   Can you get them? negative.
Okay, we're square now, right? negative.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car? positive.
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him? negative.
Hey boss, it's not a science. negative.
They were all French guys. negative.
Everything. negative.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me. positive.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me. negative.

And the other car? negative.
They don't have a wine list. positive.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me. negative.

This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France. negative.
He speaks about himself in the third person? negative.
I think we went the wrong way. positive.
The money isn't here. negative.

You're not helping. negative.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine? positive.
Algeria. negative.
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us. negative.
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys? negative.
Who's gonna see it there? negative.
Can't sleep? positive.
Sounds boring. positive.
Why? negative.
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay? negative.
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day. positive.
Do you think you are a real master? positive.
You're home late... or should I say early? positive.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you. positive.
You don't seem to understand. negative.
I'll socialize with whomever I please. negative.
I'm tired now. negative.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired. negative.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to... negative.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career. positive.
No, really? negative.
You, sister... negative.
They forced me to marry! negative.
Never! negative.
You shouldn't have come. negative.
Mu Bai...It's been too long. negative.
You were enlightened? negative.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te? negative.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking. negative.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking! negative.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods. positive.
She needs direction... and training. positive.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple. negative.
You think Jade Fox will show up? negative.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real. negative.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble. negative.
I'll look around and catch up later. positive.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate. positive.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down. negative.
It's Jade Fox! negative.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter? negative.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin. positive.
What in the hell... do you call that? negative.
No onions though, okay? negative.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight. negative.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend -- negative.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit. negative.
Don't interfere. negative.
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack. negative.
I can pick out a tune now and again. negative.
You gotta go now, I bet. negative.
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention. negative.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them. negative.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar. negative.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them. negative.
Get it? negative.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going. negative.

Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko... positive.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course. positive.

Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you. positive.
Are you okay? negative.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before. positive.

Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me. positive.
The Fountainhead. negative.
At this hour? I don't think so. negative.

Give me a minute. I'll be right down. negative.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible. positive.
That's repulsive. negative.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior. negative.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend. negative.
What are you reading? negative.
Somerset Maugham. negative.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive. positive.
What? negative.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person. negative.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously. positive.
Lighten up. negative.
Am I bothering you? negative.
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe. negative.
Because I'm in love with you. negative.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me! negative.

Oh baby... oh baby... negative.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah. negative.
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you? positive.
Where is she?! negative.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got... negative.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me. negative.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and -- negative.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house? negative.

Hey Ronald. negative.
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap -- negative.
Does she go up to the Farren's often? negative.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born. positive.
What are saying, darling? negative.
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them. positive.

Hey, did you get contacts? negative.
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what? negative.
Why would they exaggerate? negative.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up. negative.

What the hell is the tampon test? negative.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that. negative.
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone. positive.

Why the fuck would you do that? negative.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark. negative.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells... negative.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you. negative.

You wanna get some coffee? negative.
How about you? Briefs or boxers? negative.
I really gotta get going. negative.
What are they for? negative.

But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces? positive.
No, why? negative.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country. negative.
Is it that funny? negative.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs. positive.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that. negative.

Don't know that either. positive.
They didn't have faces. positive.

How do you know I'm innocent? negative.
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them? positive.
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo... negative.

Are you threatening me? negative.
They could put you in jail. negative.
I don't think so positive.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something. positive.
Oh my God... negative.
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape. negative.
Thanks, I wrote it. negative.
Dave... negative.

That was quite a thing you did today. negative.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature. positive.

They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind. negative.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable. negative.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same? negative.
A yawp? negative.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer. positive.

What was that? negative.
Check it out! negative.
Maybe it's the wrong ship. positive.
Hey! What are you trying to pull! negative.

Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do. negative.

Mr. Webster -- you will help him? positive.
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l! positive.
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. positive.

Where are you going? negative.
You're very perceptive. negative.
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying? negative.

Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault. positive.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there? negative.
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion. negative.
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane. negative.
Hans.  Your Hans. negative.

Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that? positive.
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others. negative.
Jesus, you're the man! negative.
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it. positive.

I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip... positive.

Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted. negative.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis. positive.

It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on-- positive.
What does that have to do with you? positive.
Was Zavitz in trouble? negative.
Yes. But we can't. negative.
Then what's your goddam opinion? negative.
What about the tapes? negative.
Am I to understand-- negative.
Who? negative.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle. negative.
Yes sir. negative.
If they've looked at the video. negative.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources. negative.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary. negative.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units. positive.
Yes? negative.
We're not stupid, Reynolds. negative.
No thank you. negative.
Then let's assume I don't. positive.
Which stall? negative.
Why did you follow me yesterday? negative.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel. negative.
You sing.  All the time. negative.
We took several photographs, there's no need. positive.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them. negative.
This is not very good, is it? negative.
Shall we be all right? negative.
Do they know them? positive.
When were you most happy? negative.
What else? negative.
I can still taste you. negative.
Arabic? negative.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing. negative.
Why did you hold his collar? negative.
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it? negative.
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here? positive.
You're wearing the thimble. negative.
Don't leave me! negative.
Oh dear. negative.
I'm sorry, Katharine. negative.
A broken car? negative.
What kind of photographs? negative.
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her. positive.
If I could just see some identification. negative.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable. negative.
What did you do? negative.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore. negative.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of. positive.
I believe I'm rather late. negative.
When's Clifton picking you up? negative.
May God make safety your companion. negative.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was - negative.
Or was it Toronto? positive.
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright? negative.
Buon' giorno. positive.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything? negative.
Is it you?  If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you? negative.
Have a drink. negative.
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this - positive.
Why do you think?  About my staying? negative.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons. negative.
Candaulesyou're laughing at me. positive.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery. negative.
How?  How can you see anything? negative.
I can see my wife in that view. positive.
Why are you so determined to keep me alive? negative.
He's Canadian. negative.
This is Captain McGann. positive.
I'll probably marry him. negative.
I'm still here. negative.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep. negative.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk. positive.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door. negative.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all. negative.
What do I do? positive.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick. negative.
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man. negative.
What are you up to? negative.
It's what I've learned. negative.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting. positive.
Why Picton? negative.
He's gone, hasn't he? negative.
Hello. negative.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please. negative.
Whoa - give me a chance! positive.
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private. positive.
You've got a mustache. positive.
What's happening?  Am I needed? negative.
Yessir. negative.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition. negative.
Darling, Peter says I could stay positive.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall. negative.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry. negative.
The windows don't open. negative.
So he popped the pane? negative.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high. negative.
Mac's signature. negative.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now? positive.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status? negative.
I have a question... negative.
You disappeared. negative.
You're not taking me seriously. negative.
And I thought we were getting on so well. negative.
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you? negative.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on. negative.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest. negative.
How much am I paying? negative.
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake. negative.
Motorcycle. negative.
Only a week? negative.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are! negative.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good. negative.
On what? Another job? negative.
So you're testing <u>me</u> now? negative.
To us. To the Mask. negative.
You're nervous again. negative.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then? negative.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance. negative.
Be careful not to break the laser beams. negative.
What? negative.
You've got everything planned. positive.
What about the rules? negative.
Well...What are we doing? negative.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6. negative.
The oscilloscope's already programmed. negative.
You can't be serious. negative.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank. negative.
You shouldn't have. negative.
But would you--would you-- positive.
Four billion dollars. negative.
That's because you grew up rich. negative.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do. negative.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush... positive.
He looks familiar. negative.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think? positive.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports. negative.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack. positive.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good. negative.
The key to success is using the right tools. negative.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC. positive.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me. negative.
You'll just have to have faith. negative.
My friend, you always surprise me. positive.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad. negative.
Tony Marvin. negative.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon? positive.
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis? negative.
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over. positive.
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer -- positive.
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you. negative.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place. positive.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit. positive.
Cause of the chromium. negative.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick. negative.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means -- negative.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here. negative.
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an -- negative.
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays. positive.
All I have is hundreds. negative.
You do know how to do that, don't you? positive.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax? positive.
So what made you think it was? positive.
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting. negative.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not. negative.
You think there's more? positive.
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock. negative.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work. positive.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know. negative.
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is. negative.
I like this case. positive.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about. negative.
Hey.  I like working with you. positive.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off. negative.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make? negative.
Whoa.  No shit. negative.
Counts? negative.
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>! negative.
Fuck Kurt. negative.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer. positive.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look. positive.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley? negative.
Hunh-uh.  What's that? negative.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you? positive.
What's going on in there? negative.
How come her own mom isn't helping her? positive.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will. positive.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is. negative.
Great.  Another deadbeat. positive.
You're around every afternoon? negative.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know. positive.
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know. positive.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there. negative.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean? negative.
That's Ed. negative.
About this. negative.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time. positive.
Thank you. negative.
They up? negative.
And I miss you. negative.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick. positive.
No, I need my car -- positive.
Someone stole my stuff. negative.
Where's my paycheck? negative.
I know.  It's an awful lot. positive.
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie? negative.
It'll be fine, yeah. positive.
Wow, that's soon -- negative.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study. negative.
It was .... the Emperor .... negative.
My lord. negative.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field. positive.
Will he finish what he begins? negative.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse. negative.
I can't ... negative.
You must survive, Luke. negative.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master. positive.
... Luke, you must not go. negative.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips. negative.
... the power? negative.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in. negative.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships. negative.
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie. negative.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you? positive.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like. negative.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on? positive.
What are you so grouchy about? negative.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir. positive.
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ... positive.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him. negative.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left. positive.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct .... negative.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder. negative.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us .... positive.
We've got to get out of this shower. positive.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden. negative.
They're moving away. negative.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes. negative.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field. negative.
I see it Chewie, hang on. negative.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what? negative.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian. negative.
I don't like this. positive.
You look silly. negative.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right. negative.
No thanks. negative.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true. positive.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba. negative.
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway? negative.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her? positive.
What about Leia and the Wookiee? negative.
No. negative.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in-- negative.
I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it. negative.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed? negative.
A tremor! negative.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ... negative.
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while? positive.
Jabba the Hutt? negative.
This hyperdrive had better work. negative.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi. positive.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration. negative.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel. negative.
Price?  What do you mean? negative.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger? negative.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering. negative.
Will they die? negative.
And sacrifice Han and Leia? negative.
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated. negative.
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true. negative.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away. positive.
Good God. positive.
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past. negative.
What, Lewis? negative.
Go easy, Stevie. negative.
Humans? negative.
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve. negative.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you. negative.
Cuervo...? negative.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised. negative.
Oh Cuervo... negative.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff? negative.
Defense against what? negative.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin? negative.
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you. negative.
I said pull over. negative.
Where are they going? positive.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe. negative.
How do you know all this? negative.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer. negative.
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake. negative.
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end! positive.
How do we get out of here? negative.
Where's the anti-toxin...? negative.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars. positive.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel. positive.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson. negative.
But your life and lands are far from here. positive.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me. negative.
I want to thank you. negative.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen. positive.
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I-- positive.
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy. negative.
Excalibur! Is it true? negative.
What is this place, Merlin? negative.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter. positive.
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself. positive.
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live. negative.
Just a man. A knight in the King's service. negative.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here. positive.
It is. negative.
A lovestruck page! negative.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river. negative.
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues? negative.
It's- negative.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear. positive.
Hello? negative.
May I ask...? negative.
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors? negative.
Groceries maybe? A package? positive.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night? positive.
But it's clean? positive.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom? negative.
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math. positive.
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor. negative.
Do you keep any drugs in your house? negative.
Are you sure? negative.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean. positive.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right? negative.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime... negative.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over? positive.
Wanna drink. negative.
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water. negative.
What kind of stuff? negative.
We'll see when we get home okay. positive.
Hey, where'd this come from? negative.
You've been playing with it? negative.
You really don't want me to play huh? negative.
Regan, why are you reading that? negative.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature. negative.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do? positive.
Mr. Dennings? negative.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this? negative.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one. negative.
Oh my God! negative.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing? positive.
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking? negative.
Karras. negative.
Hi Chris. Great party. positive.
I believe you. negative.
Goodnight Dims. negative.
You just missed them. negative.
Do you like films? positive.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go? negative.
Another one. Had your lunch? negative.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear? negative.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it. positive.
Quod nomen mihi est? negative.
No. negative.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first? negative.
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen. negative.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. positive.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever. positive.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien! negative.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon. positive.
Shut up!! negative.
What is it? negative.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting. positive.
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards. positive.
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church. negative.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps. negative.
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that. positive.
Hey, Father? You like movies? positive.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia. negative.
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime! negative.
...look down in pity... negative.
Is it Captain Howdy? negative.
Yeah, come on in. negative.
So? negative.
Beasley. negative.
What's wrong with them? negative.
Twenty years, Ma ... negative.
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack. positive.
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack. positive.
Count it. negative.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack. positive.
You're their uncle. negative.
They don't.  They're always asking about you. positive.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive. positive.
What do you think? positive.
You look awful. negative.
We gotta go, Jack. negative.
You gotta go. positive.
What're you talking about? negative.
Jack. negative.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk. negative.
That's what we agreed. negative.
I'm not unhappy. negative.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay? negative.
Jack. negative.
What are you, crazy? negative.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class. positive.
Get out of here! negative.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all. negative.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.' negative.
I figure that way we won't get confused. negative.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care? negative.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that? negative.
You saw wrong. positive.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak. negative.
Expensive hangover. negative.
April. negative.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he? positive.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to. negative.
Be reasonable, Jack. negative.
What're you doing? negative.
What disease? negative.
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one? negative.
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think? positive.
Stay off it. negative.
You weren't there. positive.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean. positive.
Go ahead. negative.
Looks like these got a few years on them. positive.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay. negative.
Charlie called. negative.
So what'd you think? positive.
You sure? negative.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here. negative.
Your limo's ready, Ma. negative.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up. positive.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here? negative.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance. negative.
I sing now? negative.
So? negative.
What I mean is -- negative.
Nine. negative.
Fucking. negative.
Maybe it's legit. positive.
You play all these places? negative.
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ... negative.
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend? negative.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd? positive.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack? negative.
Whatcha doin' over there? negative.
How come? negative.
Brought it. negative.

Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail. positive.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum. negative.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people. positive.
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here! negative.
Happily married, probably. negative.
Will you stand still so I can do this! negative.
Beautiful night huh? negative.
You a fag too? negative.
OWWW....What are you nuts?! negative.
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem. negative.
I don't drink coffee... negative.
No, I... negative.
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front. positive.
Well, id'n that nice. negative.
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song. negative.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out. negative.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it... negative.
I'm going on over there... negative.
I'm sorry. negative.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..." negative.
What? negative.
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that! positive.
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back. positive.
Sure... negative.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that. negative.
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything? negative.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me! positive.
What's your name? negative.
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean. positive.
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast. negative.
Can I get you anything else? negative.
No. We have tomatoes. negative.
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee. positive.
Wasn't it, ladies? negative.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV. negative.
Sorry. negative.
No. negative.
Robert... negative.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin. negative.
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either... negative.
Maybe you better stay, then. positive.
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming... negative.
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something? negative.
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look? negative.
Like what? negative.
Do you want some gingerbread? negative.
With applesauce? positive.
You're leaving? negative.
But what about me? negative.
Swimming? negative.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest? negative.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself. negative.
If you're free. negative.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me... negative.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response. positive.
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow... negative.
No inner feeling. negative.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that. positive.
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert... negative.
Four or five years. negative.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert? negative.
She's tremendously gifted, this girl. positive.
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on. negative.
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell. positive.
You've been staying in a motel all this time? positive.
Oh, no. You're more than welcome. negative.
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time. negative.
Oh no, it's been much more than that. negative.
I don't think that's true. positive.
I don't know where you were, penis envy. positive.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything... negative.
And what about love? negative.
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure... negative.
Well... negative.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know. negative.
Don't call me "mack," honey. negative.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean. negative.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean... positive.
Pardon me? negative.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break. negative.
Fine. negative.
What? negative.
Not now, I'm busy negative.
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is. positive.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated. negative.
What? negative.
Yo. negative.
Remember me, from the pool? positive.
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos? positive.
Whadja wanna see me about? negative.
Wussup? negative.
I gotta go take a piss. negative.
The one with the phat ass? negative.
You looking for somebody? negative.
You here to see somebody? negative.
What she look like? negative.
No. negative.
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even -- negative.
God I admire you. positive.
That's what he said. negative.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know. positive.
Creasy, how old are you? negative.
Hey, what are you doing? negative.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you? negative.
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin... negative.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this. positive.
Greetings, everyone. negative.
This one's going to be even more fun. negative.
So where do you know Alan from? positive.
That's two. negative.
No children? negative.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly. negative.
I think Id rather have drugs. positive.
What, the heat here? negative.
Oh my God! negative.
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something. positive.
I guess not. negative.
You should have proved that in a court of law. negative.
Good evening. negative.
Read this, please. negative.
My parents were great fans of the former President. negative.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son. negative.
Has he? negative.
He sighs. negative.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April. positive.
Because we can't. negative.
I'm still here. negative.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you. positive.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent. negative.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else. negative.
Only if you promise not to return me. negative.
Shoot. negative.
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did --- negative.
Did you say cops? negative.
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday. negative.
His bride. Cute as a button. negative.
John who? negative.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really. negative.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied. negative.
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player. negative.
You ordered it here? negative.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you? positive.
Lunch... negative.
All this goes on Underhill's bill? positive.
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.' negative.
Can I ask you a question? negative.
Why'd you let me in? negative.
Good point. negative.
What about his parents? negative.
What are you talking about? negative.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented... positive.
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me. positive.
What's wrong, Gail? negative.
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.' negative.
You can't do that. negative.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.' negative.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk? negative.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six? negative.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar? negative.
You want I set up? negative.
The door was unlocked. negative.
I commend him on his choice. negative.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay? negative.
Who? negative.
How gray? negative.
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank. positive.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt. negative.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story. negative.
Fletch, you want an apology? negative.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill. negative.
No, I ain't got you... positive.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself. negative.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality. negative.
What cheap shit... hey, waiter! negative.
Art Mo-o-o-ney! negative.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle. negative.
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you? positive.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter. positive.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya? negative.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure. negative.
All your friends call you Jazz. negative.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand... positive.
How'd you get this from her? negative.
Hello, Ford... negative.
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting. negative.
Got those Vomit invites here... positive.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so... negative.
Hello? negative.
Zuzu, wake up... negative.
Ford, you were right! negative.
Suck a dick, I left my purse... negative.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done. positive.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know... positive.
So, did you find my dad? positive.
It's me. negative.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit. positive.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame. negative.
Polo. negative.
The point? negative.
Jazz, we're talking here. negative.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then? negative.
Shit. negative.
You'd said something about proof... negative.
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made... negative.
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company... positive.
Hi, private eye guy! positive.
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were. positive.
What? negative.
Got a wife named Angie. negative.
Who knows? positive.
What's your name, asshole? negative.
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux. negative.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat. positive.
Comment va-t-elle? negative.
Il est en retard. negative.
What's your story? negative.
All right, get up on that bar and dance. negative.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean. positive.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping. negative.
Where's he from? negative.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent. positive.
Who stuck up the laundromat? negative.
Never trust a nigger. negative.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too. positive.
The greaser with the blonde. positive.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea. negative.
Popeye. negative.
You want the red or the white? negative.
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute. negative.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop. negative.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers. negative.
Hey, Bo. negative.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans? positive.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years. negative.
Yeah. positive.
No, I don't. positive.
Where's the collar, in the cells? negative.
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow. negative.
You okay, man? negative.
How about a little of the King? negative.
Damn. negative.
How was your tour? negative.
Butch called. negative.
Where's Johnny? negative.
You give him his drops? negative.
I'm off. negative.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio. negative.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play. positive.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about. negative.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey. negative.
Frank, we need to talk... positive.
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman. negative.
Deleon. negative.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank. negative.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't. negative.
Where are you transmitting from? positive.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want. negative.
What? negative.
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15. negative.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon. negative.
What'd you say your name was? negative.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me? negative.
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were? negative.
What the hell... negative.
How could this be happening? positive.
No wait, don't go! positive.
What are you talking about? negative.
Yeah, it's me. positive.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good. negative.
What?  Johnny, what's wrong? negative.
When? negative.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away. negative.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar? negative.
Whatta we do now? negative.
Got it. negative.
What are we like in...1998? negative.
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this. positive.
What? negative.
Please, Dad, just do it. positive.
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here. negative.
John.  John, you all right? negative.
My father didn't die in a fire? negative.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that. positive.
She makes ten. negative.
Which means he probably knew her. positive.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work. negative.
I look familiar? negative.
Nah, just working the job. positive.
What is that? negative.
No more... I can't! negative.
What're you gonna do? negative.
Why don't we go take a swim? negative.
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see. negative.
Hey Deb... can you hear me? negative.
Maybe we should do some exercise. negative.
What's the matter?! negative.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't. negative.
What's this? negative.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears? negative.
Shelly!  Where are you?! negative.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet. negative.
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please... negative.
Could we move a little faster? negative.
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him. positive.
Please... be cool. positive.
See anything? negative.
I don't see anything. positive.
What're you doing? negative.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt. positive.
What? negative.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing. negative.
....with a woman's touch. negative.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them. negative.
What it is? negative.
No.  No, it's not... positive.
So what are ya drawin'? negative.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time. negative.
You mean you had a bad dream. negative.
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh? negative.
But what if they try and scare us? negative.
So where's Cort gone off to? negative.
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective? negative.
I gotta show you Jason's grave. negative.
Well, let's hope not! negative.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of -- negative.
I know who you are. negative.
No, I -- negative.
Look -- negative.
What do you want? negative.
Legs giving you trouble? negative.
Ed... negative.
What's the problem here? negative.
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that. negative.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am. positive.
Tell me. positive.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here. positive.
Look, I know I treated her bad -- positive.
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her! negative.
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch. negative.
What do you mean you've never made a prank call? positive.
Have you seen Tamara? negative.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is. positive.
What are you going to do? negative.
Time to check out the waiters. negative.
Where's the radio? negative.
Dear Christ... negative.
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood? negative.
You have no right... negative.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion. positive.
Did you find Rennie? positive.
I doubt very much that one even exists. positive.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake. negative.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land. negative.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about. negative.
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school. negative.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you? positive.
I...I don't know... positive.
I've got the numbers. positive.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall. negative.
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further... positive.
I didn't mean for you to go! positive.
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly... negative.
You have to call the police... negative.
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding. negative.
I opened thousands of brains. negative.
Big mess every time. negative.
Under the Manhattan Bridge. negative.
Don't talk like that. positive.
Very dangerous. negative.
Tonight. What's tonight? negative.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca? positive.
Where are you going? negative.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now. negative.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live? negative.
What do you mean? negative.
Great game. negative.
What are we talking about? negative.
Of course I saw it. positive.
Let's work on it. negative.
This could be it. negative.
What about her? negative.
She died. negative.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all. negative.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed. negative.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning. positive.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years. positive.
She is kicking you out. negative.
Opening night? negative.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk. negative.
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor. negative.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play. positive.
What do we want? negative.
Am I really so deeply repugnant? negative.
See, Daddy. negative.
Your father said you might be here. negative.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me. negative.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other. negative.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy. positive.
This could be it! negative.
Who is it? negative.
Where the hell are you? negative.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?' positive.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand? negative.
Let's not start that again. negative.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here. negative.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps. negative.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody. negative.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over. negative.
They're my team. negative.
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.' negative.
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror. negative.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand? negative.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening. negative.
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said. positive.
What do you mean? negative.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer. negative.
Yes. negative.
Yes. negative.
There was a review. positive.
Oh. You know him. positive.
Endearing. negative.
Say it again. positive.
You know what. positive.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world. positive.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things. positive.
What? Come on, Paisley. negative.
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what? negative.
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man. negative.
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger. negative.
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"... positive.
What was he like? negative.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere. negative.
Are you going to walk all the way? negative.
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about. negative.
I would rather march. negative.
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye. negative.
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else. negative.
They're sparing no one, I see. negative.
Assuming we are in agreement? negative.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway? negative.
Have you read his magazine? negative.
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible? negative.
Who are you trying to convince? negative.
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this? negative.
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance. negative.
What a pity. negative.
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time. positive.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb? negative.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops. negative.
That's the last. positive.
From what budget? negative.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want? negative.
Would you care to look--in the telescope? negative.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place. negative.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do. positive.
You okay, Jerome? negative.
I don't know exactly, Jerome. positive.

A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts. negative.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now. negative.
Where do you want to go? negative.
It doesn't look like that. positive.

No choice. I had a visit from somebody. negative.
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother? positive.
What's it got to do with you? positive.
How'd it happen, then? negative.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on. positive.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank. negative.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret? negative.
I want to talk to you later. negative.
Nothing more? Just another feller? positive.
Though nicer than most? negative.

Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed. negative.
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed. negative.
You have a problem? negative.
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch... negative.
The people downtown said... positive.
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going... negative.
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the...

Fuck you, Dave... negative.
Fuck her... negative.
Harriett... negative.
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it. positive.

What? negative.
Rick... negative.
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...? negative.
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours? negative.
I've got to talk to you. positive.
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go? negative.

What? negative.
You cashed the check? negative.
We haven't got a lead... negative.
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right. negative.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left. positive.

What took so long? negative.
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would. negative.
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week. negative.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true. negative.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore. positive.
Then why do you come to me? negative.
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me. negative.
Is Kay coming? negative.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party. positive.
Deanna, will you get back into the house! negative.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you. negative.
He is weak. negative.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him? negative.
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times. negative.

I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much. positive.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth. negative.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife! positive.

The 'patrone' is here. positive.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'? negative.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider. negative.

Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record. positive.
Does it feel like a boy? negative.
I had no idea... negative.
Why don't you sit down? negative.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE! negative.

Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas? negative.
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him. negative.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast. negative.
Says who? negative.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches. negative.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami. negative.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami. positive.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty? negative.
I know. positive.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why. negative.

I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me. positive.

No.  It won't do. negative.
All right.  Let's take it off now. negative.

I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week. positive.
Talk? To you? After what you did! negative.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody. positive.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it. negative.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter. negative.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent. negative.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest. positive.
Who's gonna do that? positive.
What about the schools? negative.
Keep 'em coming. negative.
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate? negative.
Well, we gotta dig him up again. negative.
It's still better than letting somebody find him. negative.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions. negative.
Watch this. positive.
It's a fait accompli? negative.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me. positive.

Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything? negative.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot. negative.
Where'd you find such creeps? negative.
You know what to do? positive.

How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops? negative.
Did he say what they're asking him about? negative.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can. negative.
He didn't call? negative.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade. positive.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards. positive.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen. positive.
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime. negative.
When's the arraignment? negative.
Who'd you call? negative.
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride. positive.
What? negative.
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother... negative.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have. positive.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years. negative.
What class? negative.
Oh... negative.
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people. negative.
Oh, right. negative.
--That isn't funny-- negative.

Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it. negative.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important. negative.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here. positive.
Okay. How? negative.
No. negative.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here-- positive.
It's right.  Take it home with you. positive.
Well, I'm sorry. negative.
You know, you're no longer required to come here. positive.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet. negative.
Good to see you. negative.
Would you excuse us? positive.
Why would he do that? negative.
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake-- positive.
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had. negative.
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself! negative.
How about one now? negative.
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery? negative.
About thirty million to one. negative.
So, you finally got a job Morgan? negative.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about. positive.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children. negative.
Who is "Danny Terrio?" negative.
Probably not. negative.
What is? negative.
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down. negative.
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about? negative.
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!" negative.
How'd it go? negative.
My wife's dead. negative.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night. negative.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon? negative.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife? negative.
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl." negative.
Do you think you're alone? positive.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road. negative.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation. negative.
I know. positive.
Don't fuck with me. positive.
I know. positive.
That's what you want? negative.
No. Thank you. negative.
You suck. negative.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us. positive.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you. positive.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate. negative.

I think I can make it to South Boston. positive.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about? negative.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry? negative.
Do you play the piano? negative.
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me! positive.
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker. negative.
You doin' the hirin'? positive.
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go. negative.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license. positive.
Ready, Pa? negative.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before. positive.
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself-- negative.
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'? negative.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl. negative.
She's hotter'n a heifer. negative.
Any gas? negative.
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it? negative.

That's the way it is. negative.
Government. negative.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me. positive.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say. positive.
Ain't you seen your folks since then? negative.
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas. positive.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead? negative.
She's settlin'. positive.
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five? negative.
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else. positive.
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know. positive.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey? negative.
How about a lift, mister? negative.
Get to what? negative.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this. positive.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got. positive.
Yes, ma'am. negative.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out. positive.
What's the matter, Grampa? negative.
How 'bout Granma? negative.
Where you going? negative.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby? negative.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way. positive.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it. positive.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on. positive.
Mad, Ma? negative.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep. positive.
Didn' you get no sleep? positive.
Was Granma bad? negative.
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad. negative.
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk. negative.
I ain't full. negative.
Looks like you done it. negative.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me. negative.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out. negative.
What is it? negative.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma. positive.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n. negative.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now. negative.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too. positive.
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny. negative.
Tommy? negative.
They gone. negative.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now. positive.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop. positive.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it. negative.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back. negative.
But what about this? negative.
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband. positive.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place. negative.

Are you going to the reunion? negative.
You met people. positive.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock. negative.
Yes. negative.
Hello...? negative.
You're fucking psycho. negative.
No time. positive.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood. negative.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper. negative.
Not the other way around...? positive.
Is it something you've done? negative.
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life. positive.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money. negative.
How do you know? positive.
You needn't be so frank with me about your work. positive.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families. negative.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway. positive.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right? negative.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece? negative.
Hey, Ken. How have you been? negative.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same. positive.
Well? negative.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the -- negative.
They blame you for the compromise. negative.
Enough? negative.
I have scruples. Next. positive.
This is not good. negative.
You have. negative.

Debi's house. negative.
Ten years. What happened!? negative.
I have to get my head back into my work. positive.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force? negative.
Why not? negative.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner... negative.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them. positive.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel... negative.
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now. positive.
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too. positive.
The answer's no. negative.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead. negative.
Yeah. positive.
How did you meet her? negative.
You missed a button. negative.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us... negative.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right? negative.
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out. negative.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it. positive.
Yeah? positive.
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to -- negative.
You should call your dad before it gets too late. negative.
Did he tell you that? negative.
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers. positive.
He's still sitting in that damn field. negative.
I'll come. negative.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork. negative.
Does anybody out there want something to drink? positive.
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you -- negative.
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing... positive.
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!! negative.
Started what? negative.
Let's bring your bags inside. negative.
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim? positive.
Great! positive.
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me? negative.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone. negative.
What about Grace? negative.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter. positive.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early. negative.
Why did you go? negative.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this? negative.
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the -- negative.
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability... negative.
What if she doesn't want to go? negative.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit? positive.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all? positive.
I miss you, Annie. negative.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon. positive.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn. positive.
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark. positive.
No. I am a "tubab." positive.
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well... positive.
How's Peterson's holding up for you? negative.
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom... negative.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt? negative.
You and Frank ever take a vacation? negative.

It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks. negative.
Mixed salad. negative.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter. positive.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once. negative.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on. negative.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords. negative.

Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake. negative.
Where did you get Pilgrim from? negative.
I can't... not yet... negative.
"... and I said that"... negative.
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over? negative.
Hey, darlin'. positive.
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts. positive.
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all." positive.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters. positive.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap... negative.
What's that? negative.
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight? negative.
Right. negative.
Very impressive. negative.
Oh wow, we are fried. negative.
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?! negative.

Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him. negative.
Who sent you? negative.
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit! negative.
That woman's gonna call the cops. negative.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up? negative.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now. negative.
We're cool. negative.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people. negative.
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret? negative.

Paul, this scotch is exceptional. positive.
The United Nations are still here. positive.
Satellites. negative.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man.

I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us. negative.

Please.....anyone....help me? negative.
For the love of God....please...? negative.

You don't think I know? positive.
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this? negative.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it. negative.
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly. negative.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman. negative.
Concentrate!  She can hear you! negative.
What was she afraid of? negative.

The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery. positive.
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back? negative.
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage. positive.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it. negative.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there! negative.
Uh-huh? negative.
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable. negative.

Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one? negative.

Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically? negative.
Anna, what are you trying to say... negative.
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment... negative.
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained. negative.
And I'll bring my entourage... negative.
What have you been doing? negative.
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I.... negative.
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is.... positive.

Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful? negative.
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing." negative.
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas... negative.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle? positive.
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words... negative.
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job... negative.

Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to. positive.
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger! positive.
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy... negative.
What a horrible little person. negative.
Cigarette? negative.
You're from Muncie?! negative.
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence -- negative.
I'm sure I -- negative.
Smitty. negative.
...You do? negative.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions -- positive.
...Certain people are -- positive.
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar. negative.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year. negative.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you -- positive.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex. positive.
For Pete's sake, Norville! negative.
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families -- positive.
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile -- positive.
Now, Amy -- negative.
Just got hired today! positive.
How long've you been down here? negative.
...Geez. negative.

Wuddya mean, buddy? negative.
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I -- negative.
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal. positive.
But look, I'm president of the company now and I -- negative.
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him? negative.

I've no influence with Mr. Holland. positive.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here. positive.
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on. positive.
Is this disease common in the tropics? positive.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope. positive.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important. negative.
You're single? negative.
The West Indies? negative.
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful. negative.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill. negative.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian? negative.
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute? negative.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay. negative.
Why was the maid crying? negative.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain. positive.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened. positive.
Well? negative.
An accident at the mill? positive.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother. negative.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had. negative.

Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it. negative.
If you're going to insult me -- negative.
You've... negative.
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone -- positive.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments -- positive.

It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties. negative.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's? negative.
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right-- positive.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly -- negative.
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it. negative.
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows. negative.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos. positive.
I suppose. Why? negative.
Thanks again. For the dinner. negative.
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology. negative.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization? negative.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit -- positive.
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she? negative.
Arise and shine, young Hood. negative.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up. negative.
Huh? negative.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff. positive.
Would it matter?  And what's that? negative.
Geometry? negative.
Why are you so good at math but not in English? negative.
Did you tell Sandy? negative.

Hello, Charles. negative.
Hood residence. negative.
Right. negative.
Well, you can... positive.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me. negative.
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us. negative.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents? negative.
Will, you can't blame yourself. negative.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap. negative.

I don't know. positive.
She wouldn't tell me! positive.

She used some stupid code name. negative.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace. negative.
Yes.  Like that. negative.
You're not following procedure. negative.
Monstrous. negative.
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away. positive.
That is a picture, nothing more. negative.
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing. positive.
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter. negative.
No, my beloved, my child. negative.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me. positive.
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen. negative.
You didn't even warm them, did you? positive.
But you're the fairest by far. negative.
Laudanum! negative.
Don't Louis -- negative.
Claudia! You did that? negative.
You want me to be a doll forever? negative.
You... fed on me? negative.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him. negative.
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means. positive.
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die. negative.
How do I look? negative.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense. positive.
This is no performance. negative.
This is monstrous! positive.
Do you think I would let them harm you? positive.
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it! negative.
Vampires. We thrive on blood. negative.
Let's call that a start. negative.
Come, you're going to feed now. negative.
Take him. negative.
What have I done? negative.
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly. negative.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell. negative.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs. negative.
As did the one who made me. negative.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses. negative.
Where are we? negative.
I didn't want to kill her. negative.
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!! negative.
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you. negative.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light. positive.
You can't look at them... negative.

There is nothing to discuss. negative.
The whale's mouth? negative.

Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration. positive.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale. positive.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite. positive.
Mrs. Silvera? negative.
Need a ride? negative.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff? negative.
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal. negative.

Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke. negative.

Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins. negative.
I can have them walk backwards. negative.
I told you, something's upset them. positive.
I'm sorry. negative.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard. negative.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes. negative.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers! positive.
I will. negative.
I want that shark alive. negative.
Why? negative.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog. positive.
Not at all. negative.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed. negative.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else. positive.
Hello.  I think his nap's over. positive.

And it's always worked? positive.
What are we getting out of this old bucket? negative.
How long have you known Hoagie? positive.
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction.... negative.
We lost it.... negative.
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie.... negative.
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything? negative.

Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that. positive.

You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character. positive.
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion. negative.

It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you... positive.

Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other.

I'll bet. negative.
So...what did you think of the tape. positive.
What do you mean? negative.

Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here. negative.
I'm gonna start rolling -- negative.
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail -- negative.

Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother? positive.
You know how improbable this is...? positive.
'Cause you don't lose loads? negative.
Available cash is not an issue for us... negative.
I forgot the napkins. negative.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts? positive.
Where would I go? negative.
Is this the protective male talk? positive.
If they attack you... negative.
What...? negative.
Yeah. positive.
You got something to say, José, let's hear it. negative.
So? negative.
How much we looking for? negative.
Where'd you go? negative.
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya? negative.
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network. negative.
What is going on...?! negative.
What's your take? negative.
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there... positive.
From whom...? positive.
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track. negative.
What are you talking about? negative.
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny." negative.
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again... positive.
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside? negative.
As in, your ass is dead in the water. negative.
Who are you talking to? negative.
You sure? negative.
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude... negative.
Conveyance? negative.
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story. negative.
So lay it out, my brother... negative.
What do you care? negative.
This the load you lost a while back? negative.
What...? negative.
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty... negative.
The Statue of Liberty. negative.
You ain't coming to work? negative.
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line... negative.
You think I'm lying! negative.
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more. positive.
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that? negative.
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea? negative.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place. negative.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey? positive.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay. negative.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you... positive.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here. negative.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I... positive.
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise? positive.
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh... positive.
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ! positive.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina. negative.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more? negative.
Keep the goddam blanket on. negative.
You're what? negative.
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up... negative.
You want me to leave? negative.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome. positive.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all. negative.
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks... positive.
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain? negative.
Getchmis olsun negative.
Looks like a cheap hotel. positive.
The kids? Why are they... negative.
Yeah. positive.
Two kilos. negative.
Want me to take over? negative.
Who? negative.
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there. positive.
Why'd you do it, Billy? negative.
DAD! negative.
How far? negative.
Where are the minefields? negative.
Yes...? negative.
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar. negative.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade. negative.
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver? positive.
What's your father do? negative.
Feeling all right? negative.
What they give you? negative.
How much did you have? positive.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself. negative.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court. negative.
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it. negative.
Get the... midnight... express. negative.
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs. positive.
You got your stuff? negative.
Okay? negative.
We go back. negative.
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy! negative.
What? negative.
Just got some news on Bell. positive.
Why the suit? negative.
Never was anybody like you... positive.
Billy, what's the matter? negative.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy. positive.
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash. negative.
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place? positive.
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten. negative.
And a right. negative.
Look, I showed you my badge... negative.
The Department of Public Health... negative.
Can we get this car there? positive.
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it? positive.
What do you-? negative.
He's special. negative.
You better tell me what the hell's going on here! negative.
The lights come up, you pull the switch. negative.
But the power... positive.
He didn't do it! negative.
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things... negative.
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy... negative.
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight. negative.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts! positive.
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen. positive.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids. negative.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you... negative.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor! negative.
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them! positive.
It worked before... positive.
C'mon... negative.
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars? negative.
You sure you didn't see one of these? negative.
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions... positive.
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that. positive.
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster. positive.
This wing configuration. I've never... positive.
I'm not much of a critic. negative.
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going. negative.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek. negative.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital? negative.
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you. negative.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck. negative.
What's it about? negative.
But what? negative.
The profanity bothers you? negative.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you. negative.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75. negative.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted? negative.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again. positive.
You want me to burn my book? negative.
Set what up? negative.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write? positive.
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world... negative.
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name. positive.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again. negative.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word. negative.
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you? negative.
Well, it certainly says you. negative.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery? negative.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me. negative.
What things? negative.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non. negative.
Yes, Paul. negative.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls? negative.
You don't think he's dead, do you? positive.
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him." negative.
They're hauling Misery into court. negative.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot. negative.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne. positive.
Answer me a couple things? negative.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business-- negative.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence.. positive.
How I usually find you, Nyah. positive.
To win? negative.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time. negative.
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money. negative.
Where? negative.
Nyah! negative.
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security. negative.
What was the top bid? negative.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots.. negative.
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah. negative.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera. negative.
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan. negative.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged. positive.
- right..where is it? positive.
I wouldn't do that. negative.
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing. negative.
I need your help and I thin you can use mine. negative.
Awfully short notice.. negative.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't. positive.
So where did I got right? negative.
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief.. negative.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that? positive.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief. negative.
And that's the only reason? negative.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street.. negative.
Before you are. positive.
-- his left jacket pocket. negative.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer. positive.
Something else? positive.
I don't.  No exactly. positive.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends. positive.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded? negative.
..not in time to save him. positive.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon. positive.
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims. negative.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus. negative.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop. negative.
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live. negative.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours? negative.
Come on! negative.
To friends. negative.
That's S.O.P.. negative.
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened. positive.
What kind of show. negative.
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops. negative.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like. negative.
Did we get it? negative.
I'm walking. negative.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge. negative.
They're dead.  Jim's dead. negative.
What? negative.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here? negative.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do... negative.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away. negative.
What happened? negative.
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train. negative.
Are you damaged? negative.
<u>Are you intact</u>? negative.
I donít think so. positive.
Yes. negative.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally. negative.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan. negative.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge? positive.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal. positive.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list. negative.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close. negative.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling? negative.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it. positive.
Who are you and what are you doing here? negative.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man? positive.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir. negative.
I gotta go in there and shut it down! positive.
Zero body count. negative.
Claire. negative.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket. negative.
He won't be back in a hurry? negative.
Abort.  Thatís an order. negative.
Hey, I showed 'em to you! negative.
Jim...? negative.
I usually am. negative.
You got it. negative.
What's going on? negative.
Why don't you take a look? negative.
Whatís the problem. negative.
Try it again. negative.
Very good, Mr. Johnny. negative.
Cosmo? negative.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else. positive.
Have I been a good wife? negative.
Hi.  Hi. negative.
I have my eyes open. negative.
Johnny Cammareri. negative.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying. negative.
In a month. negative.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away. positive.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had. positive.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Here. negative.
So you'll come to the wedding, right? negative.
You're my father. negative.
You haven't once said you like my dress. positive.
It's wrong to just let them go. positive.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house. positive.
Why? negative.
You are going to marry my brother? negative.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me. negative.
Fast. negative.
When you get engaged? negative.
No. negative.
What are you doing! negative.
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool! negative.
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head! negative.
What? What have we done? negative.
This time I was trying to do everything right. negative.
I'm marrying your brother! negative.
You don't get along with anybody! positive.
What? negative.
Hi. negative.
You look beautiful. Your hair... negative.
Who painted that? negative.
So. Where are we sitting? negative.
That was just so... awful! negative.
It's really cold. negative.
What's the matter? negative.
You're making me feel guilty again. negative.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta. negative.
I'm here! negative.
This is where we're going! positive.
No, I'll tell him. positive.
Loretta? negative.
I got things to do. positive.
Bye, Aunt Rita. negative.
Hi Loretta. negative.
It's Johnny Cammareri. negative.
You never have dessert. negative.
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck. positive.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage. positive.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down. negative.
How near is she to death? negative.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house. positive.
What? negative.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception. negative.
No. But I have a hangover. positive.
He's with his dying mother! negative.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more! negative.
Hi. negative.
What about the moon? negative.
No. negative.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go. positive.
Don't fight. negative.
Talk to him. negative.
Loretta... negative.
Yes? negative.
Sorry. That was rude. negative.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that. positive.
I'll remember that. What do you do? negative.
Then why are you eating alone? negative.
Temperature's dropping. negative.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament. negative.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy. negative.
I don't know. positive.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk. negative.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo. negative.
Burn them. negative.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ... negative.
Where did you get the coconuts? negative.
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do? negative.
King of the WHO? negative.
Who are the Britons? negative.
Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle? negative.
Well, who is your lord? negative.
Order, eh -- who does he think he is? negative.
Oh! negative.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now? negative.
What word? negative.
None shall pass. negative.
A scratch?  Your arm's off. negative.
You're a liar. negative.
Hello. negative.
What is your name? negative.
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"! negative.
Ni! negative.
There!  Look! negative.
We shall attack at once. negative.
Look, you're a busy man ... negative.
... You silly sod. negative.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! positive.
Sorry ... negative.
Good idea, O Lord! negative.
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart. positive.
Exactly.  So... logically ... negative.
Nothing... There's your ninepence. negative.
He will be soon. He's very ill. negative.
I think I'll go for a walk. positive.
Thanks very much. positive.
Well taken, Concorde! negative.
Did you kill all those guards? positive.
Gosh - Is he all right? negative.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note. negative.
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ... negative.
One day, lad, all this will be yours ... negative.
I don't want land. negative.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us? negative.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him. negative.
And make sure he doesn't leave. negative.
Make sure he doesn't leave. negative.
Sir Galahad! negative.
Come Sir Galahad, quickly! negative.
... I Bet you're gay. negative.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ... negative.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ... negative.
Well ... yes ... positive.
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ... positive.
Hurry! negative.
They're all saying the word ... negative.
Not bad, not bad. negative.
I'm not sure I do, Archie. negative.
Which one of us is she flirting with? positive.
Aye, but will they? positive.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful. positive.
What are you doing?! negative.
You've got three broken ribs, man! negative.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere. positive.
She'll get over it. negative.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know. negative.
What's this? negative.
You should have someone look after you. negative.
Checked and locked, sir. negative.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it. positive.
I wish to see my mother. positive.
Convey her a message. negative.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion. negative.
Mother.... negative.
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host-- negative.
By whose authority? negative.
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself. positive.
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised! negative.
Checked and locked, sir. negative.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you. negative.
Do you? negative.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it. positive.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked. negative.
What do you know about the Highlands? positive.
Oh. negative.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now. negative.
I promised to protect her from people like you. positive.
She'll never understand it. negative.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated. negative.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so. negative.
Then why do you persist in doing it? positive.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses. negative.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne. positive.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two. negative.
What are those? negative.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you. negative.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside -- negative.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time -- positive.
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me! negative.
Well, both. negative.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl? positive.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry. negative.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am. positive.
I'm sorry, ma'am? negative.
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son. negative.
Please make sure it does not happen again. negative.
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely! negative.
Ma'am? negative.
Why is he not here? negative.
Just tell me the fucking riddle. positive.
Maybe he's not dead. positive.
Has anyone seen Greg? positive.
Sick? negative.
What's her problem? negative.
So where is he? negative.
I have to talk to you. negative.
Happy? negative.
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here". positive.
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!! negative.
It turned itself back on, Nick. negative.
Where to now? negative.
Then leave her. negative.
Where do we go? positive.
That's what I thought. negative.
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ... negative.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits. positive.
The clock's already ticking. negative.
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies. negative.
Which way? negative.
What did he do to you? negative.

Mickey! negative.
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane. negative.
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you? negative.
Who's the song bird? negative.
You guys stay on your bellies. negative.
Do you have a back up. negative.
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial--- negative.
Yours. negative.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share. negative.
Manson beat you. negative.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say? negative.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word. positive.
Not to anybody. She sings. negative.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about. positive.
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun? positive.
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else. positive.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question. positive.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here? negative.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard? negative.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone? negative.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards? negative.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up. negative.

Here's the layout of the laundry room. negative.
You can't be serious? negative.
Roger, no. negative.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year. positive.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front. positive.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra. positive.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while? negative.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes. negative.
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in. negative.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do? negative.
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig. positive.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it. positive.
Two guys? positive.
Three. negative.
So we got a deal. Four deputies--- positive.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes. negative.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke. negative.
They done that too long in my family. negative.

Well, they seem just like everyone else. positive.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you? negative.

How often is that? negative.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel. positive.
It's just that I hate empty rooms. positive.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus. positive.
Don't be too hard on him. negative.

Well, if it ain't Duff! negative.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for? positive.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'. positive.
Now you stay put! negative.
Let's go. negative.

Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry. positive.

He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly? negative.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier. negative.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long. positive.
An odd selection, Mr Case. negative.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me? negative.
I saw your girl yesterday. negative.
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts. positive.

Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it. negative.
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you. negative.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.? negative.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear. negative.
What are you talkin' about? negative.
It'll flatline your ass. negative.
Yo. negative.
What about the route to the core? negative.
What about the mainframe's access code? negative.
Want to fucking answer them? negative.
Hello, Case. negative.
I know who you are. negative.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know. negative.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales. negative.
What is it? negative.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you? positive.
Maybe something's onto him. positive.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck. negative.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here. negative.
Case... Are you alright? negative.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show. negative.
I know. positive.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase. negative.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars. negative.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974. positive.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year. negative.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around? positive.
You're Pam? negative.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea. negative.
Anita! negative.
Okay. That's bad. negative.
Now this is cute. negative.

Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf-- negative.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune. positive.
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go. negative.
That's your story! negative.
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it! negative.

Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal. negative.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material! positive.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills? negative.
Josie Grossie. negative.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here! positive.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me. negative.
Wow, Josie- you look really- negative.
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age. positive.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys? negative.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications. negative.
This seat taken? positive.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel. negative.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you. positive.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude. positive.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.-- positive.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth? negative.
I don't know. positive.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams. positive.

I figured you might like some help. negative.
You know her? positive.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love." positive.
What is this place? negative.
What is it? negative.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing. negative.
Who, Jesse? negative.
Hi. negative.
What's so funny? negative.
'Morning. negative.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this! positive.

Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood! negative.
What? negative.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light. negative.
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back? negative.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV. positive.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal? negative.
What's happening? negative.
I'm glad things have worked out for you. negative.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile? negative.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like. positive.
Freddy? negative.
What's that? negative.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news. negative.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office. positive.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place. negative.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear. negative.
I don't know... positive.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going. negative.
You're late. negative.
Yes, tell us, Nancy. positive.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities? negative.
That's right. negative.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us. positive.
I can't believe I just did that. positive.
Stop blaming yourself. negative.
Then maybe you're ready. negative.
The truth. negative.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that? positive.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body? negative.
Nancy... negative.
Okay, straight talk only in here. negative.
Somebody else is out here. negative.
How is he? negative.
What did you think? positive.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room. negative.
Hi. negative.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...? negative.
That was such a great evening. negative.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...? negative.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they? positive.
No, thanks.  I'll just look around. positive.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money. negative.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards. negative.
Coffee? negative.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest? negative.
Probably best not tell anyone about this. positive.
Hi. negative.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do. positive.
Okay -- fine. negative.
Too complicated. negative.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long. negative.
Why? negative.
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded. positive.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster. negative.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.' positive.
Eleven. negative.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?' positive.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping. negative.

Still loves you though. negative.
This painting isn't the original, is it? positive.

By the way -- it's you. negative.
Yes.  What do you think? positive.
What happened? negative.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her! positive.
Ah -- no.  It's fine. negative.
Well, fire away. positive.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347. positive.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color... positive.
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters. negative.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this. negative.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form. positive.
Oh God no. positive.
Can I help you? negative.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt. negative.
Cool, huh? negative.
Right.  No one else? negative.
Try 'Flintstone.' positive.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties. positive.
Spike. negative.
I'll talk to you in the morning. positive.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too. negative.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this. negative.
Are you sure you...? negative.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone. negative.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop. positive.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers. negative.
The one down your trousers. negative.
Why? negative.
M-m-m-ma'am? negative.
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did! negative.
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us... positive.

No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off. negative.
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay! positive.
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack? negative.
Ya like that, Chief, huh? negative.
Wait a minute... negative.
Go with him, Rose. Go with him. positive.
I'm leaving. Goodbye! negative.
Yeah, where we going? negative.
What? What? negative.
Ya know what, Fred? positive.
What are you doing? negative.
Did to me? negative.
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes! negative.
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me! negative.

Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me. negative.
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning... positive.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes... positive.
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night? negative.
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay? negative.
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss... positive.
What are they? negative.
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt. positive.
There they are! positive.
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall. negative.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day... negative.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before. negative.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'. positive.
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying... positive.
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle! negative.
What? negative.
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly. negative.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick. negative.
She was your sister. negative.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went? negative.
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay? positive.
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker. negative.
Were they pen pals? negative.
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me. negative.
What? negative.
Who's dying? negative.
No. negative.
We'll KNOW. positive.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you. negative.
It's an amazing place, don't you think? positive.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens? positive.
Hello?  Is anybody there? negative.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me. negative.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe? negative.

So what do you think? positive.
Scientologist. negative.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer. positive.

No. negative.
I don't know.  I don't think so. positive.
You don't have any idea? positive.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him. negative.
Come on, it's not so bad. negative.
Kate, is something the matter? positive.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it. negative.
I have vacation time coming to me. positive.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor. negative.
It's called... the Gritty Palace. negative.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here. negative.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams. negative.
What are you doing? negative.
I just got a dial tone-- positive.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it? positive.
Couldn't we just have taken a train? positive.
And then what, Faith? negative.
So, you've had a little bad luck. positive.
Peter found him? negative.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless". negative.
And he is living proof. negative.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it. positive.
Kate is that you? negative.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter? negative.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate? negative.
It's siesta. negative.

Huh? negative.
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now. negative.
And we didn't have to bring another present? negative.
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money. positive.
Yeah-- positive.
She what?! negative.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is. negative.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years? negative.
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter. negative.
I'm gonna take her home first. positive.
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records? negative.
It'll do. negative.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins. negative.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you. negative.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business? positive.

Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink. negative.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley. positive.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up. negative.

I can get home all right from here negative.
I remember you were in trouble all the time. negative.
What's that? negative.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they? positive.
What for? negative.

A dive? You mean, into the water? positive.
Terry! negative.
And when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of Them is that your idea? negative.
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question. negative.
His racket? negative.
I I'd like to, Edie, but  there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says positive.
What are you crying for? negative.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned. negative.
What are you going to do? negative.
It's true. negative.
I don't rate it. negative.
You... . negative.

Terry, you're bleeding. negative.
Edie. negative.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me. negative.
Then go ahead go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before. negative.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy. negative.
I don't get it! negative.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back. negative.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel. negative.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts. positive.
This is my business. positive.
What did you say? negative.
You can! negative.
Who asked him here? negative.
So help me God! positive.
I think you could have. positive.
Listen, this ain't for publication. positive.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and negative.
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys positive.

Give me a double. negative.
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'? negative.

Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of. positive.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you. positive.
Those creatures..! negative.

I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on. positive.
...And what is this? negative.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon. negative.
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken! negative.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light... positive.
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish. negative.
Oh, if there is only time! negative.
Then it is some service you desire of us. negative.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. negative.

He didn't hurt you or anything, did he? negative.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that. positive.

"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.

Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley? negative.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now. negative.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up. positive.
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come. negative.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI? positive.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more. negative.
How much for your company at chow? positive.
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke? negative.

You don't seem all that scared. negative.
You don't act like it. positive.

Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him. negative.
Is that right? negative.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV... negative.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen. negative.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances... negative.
You know who this is? positive.

A girl. negative.
Well, does it make sense to you? negative.
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous. negative.

"Hey, yourself." negative.
What are you thinking about? negative.
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break. positive.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he? positive.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address. negative.
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can. negative.

He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange. negative.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange. positive.

Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left. negative.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly. negative.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile. negative.
So beautiful! negative.
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks. negative.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only. negative.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself. negative.

Thank you, 'Mam. negative.
Oh, this is Betty. negative.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say. negative.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead. positive.
What else can we do? negative.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way. negative.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it. negative.
Well which of those three ya want fixed? negative.
You see us as capable of such a blow? negative.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together. positive.

Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents? negative.
Want me to drive you home later? positive.
Looking good out there. negative.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious. negative.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah... negative.
Yeah. Like that. positive.
Where did you get that sweater? negative.
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you. positive.
Charlie. About last nights.. negative.
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you. negative.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted? negative.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet? negative.
Does this mean you like me again? positive.
Forget it, it'll never work. negative.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there. negative.

Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last. positive.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings. negative.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores? negative.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious. positive.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today. negative.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work. negative.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.' negative.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club. positive.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time. negative.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor. positive.
Yes. negative.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea? positive.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that? positive.
Mom! negative.

I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain. negative.
You look pretty good for a corpse. positive.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack. positive.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech. positive.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night. negative.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time. negative.
Will you take of f your blouse? positive.
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it. negative.

This isn't a very good place to talk. negative.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector. negative.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes-- negative.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it. negative.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself. negative.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you. negative.
I'd like a few words with you, in private. positive.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning. negative.
Private eye? negative.
What are your rates? negative.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield? positive.
Bluff. You've waited too long. negative.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night positive.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character? positive.
How about a cup of coffee? negative.
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you? negative.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away-- positive.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed. positive.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in? negative.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine. negative.
I had a father who knew how to steal. negative.
Passkey? negative.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him. negative.
You nasty, sardonic-- negative.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why. positive.
Send that? negative.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm. negative.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector. positive.
Was that about the right angle? negative.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out. negative.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake. negative.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt? negative.
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind? positive.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us. positive.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly. positive.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy! negative.
Did you ever have a serious operation? negative.
He checks too. negative.
Ye have, have ye? negative.

Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl? negative.
I believe you won decorations during the war. negative.
Get out of here! negative.
What's this? negative.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this. positive.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry. negative.
Of course. negative.
Right. negative.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you. negative.
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield? positive.
You're kind to be so encouraging. negative.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you. positive.
Thank you. negative.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened? negative.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway? negative.
Congratulations.  Who with? negative.
I couldn't bear for it to end. negative.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way. positive.
Damn.  They're early. negative.
Why not stay? negative.
Me too. negative.
In radio we're different. negative.
Did she talk about me? negative.
Shall we have a drink or something? positive.
Not yet you know any of these people? positive.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you. negative.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot. negative.
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there. positive.
That's enough of that. negative.
The torture of small children-- negative.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained. negative.
Still in love? negative.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off? negative.
Okay, I will. negative.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back. negative.
So how is she? negative.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight. positive.
What would you call it? negative.
What have you got there? positive.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?' positive.
And that's why you never went pro? negative.
What's their program? negative.
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you? positive.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it. negative.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me? negative.
Don't screw around man, pull it! negative.
I can't do this. negative.
Three seconds... two... one... negative.
Wild ride, huh? negative.
You never were... negative.
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look? negative.
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't. positive.
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world-- positive.
Surf conditions okay? negative.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it. negative.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault. negative.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one. positive.
Oh well he must be a surfer. negative.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech. negative.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me? negative.
They're on their way to Maui. negative.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in. negative.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here. positive.
Nice place. negative.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal. negative.
Meaning you were expendable. negative.
I can barely do this in broad daylight. negative.
You had enough? negative.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it? negative.
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions. positive.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you? positive.
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys. positive.
Mean anything to you? negative.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon? negative.
What story did you give to Davis? negative.
I can accept that, it comes with the job. positive.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes. negative.
Thanks. negative.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes... positive.
You saw what? positive.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'. positive.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker. negative.
Mmmnnn...? negative.
Where the hell is his body? negative.
Georgia. negative.
Well... I might be going out to dinner. negative.
There's no way you could know that. positive.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward? negative.
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price. negative.
No.  What I have is a lot of money. negative.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time... positive.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date? positive.
You looking' for some company? negative.
New York. positive.
What's your name? negative.
You're joking. negative.
No, but it's getting there. negative.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour. negative.
Room service.  What do you drink? negative.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne. negative.
What do you like? positive.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm? negative.
Not... quite. negative.
It'd cost you. negative.
Did you buy some clothes? negative.
I think you'll approve. positive.
You always been rich? negative.
What id we run into someone I know? negative.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex? negative.
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --! negative.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you. positive.
What's that? negative.
What if I lose it? negative.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that. negative.
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff. negative.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>. positive.
You're packing. negative.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel. negative.
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge. positive.
Edward, did you hear me? negative.
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise. negative.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this. negative.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work? positive.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you? negative.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight? negative.
Who did you think? negative.
Kit, I left that money for you days ago. negative.
Yeah... I know what you mean. positive.
What kind of school? negative.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread? positive.
I'm -- I'm with a friend. negative.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see? negative.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye. positive.
Are you looking for something in particular? positive.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this? positive.
No, I'm sorry, I don't. negative.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man? negative.
I killed him myself. negative.
Catch your breath. negative.
You mock my pain! negative.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are. negative.
Can you move at all? negative.
We'll never survive. negative.
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened. positive.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too. negative.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me? negative.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife." negative.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part. negative.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting. positive.
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder. positive.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition. positive.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all. negative.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either. negative.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black -- positive.
-- Fezzik, please -- negative.
Have you any money? positive.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had? negative.
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day. negative.
Inigo. negative.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning? positive.
-hold it, hold it- negative.
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part? negative.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right! negative.
Yes. negative.
What? What? negative.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept. positive.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit. negative.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it positive.
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters. negative.
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder! negative.
Could this be a trap? negative.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight. positive.
-- anything you want -- negative.
What? What? negative.
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle. negative.
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that. negative.
Thank you for everything. negative.
Do you always begin conversations this way? positive.
You are wonderful! negative.
Who are you?! negative.
Kill me quickly. negative.
Let me explain- negative.
You're that smart? negative.
I accept. negative.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck negative.
Think it'll work? positive.
Guess what. negative.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth? negative.
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ... negative.
Yes, sir.  Thank you. negative.
Good, what is it? negative.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds. negative.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play. positive.
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for. positive.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire. negative.
What scheme? negative.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here. positive.
What??? negative.
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know. positive.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right? negative.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life. positive.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army. positive.
Maybe it's not true! negative.
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ... negative.
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime. negative.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer. positive.
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived? negative.
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down. negative.
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut. negative.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh... negative.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late. negative.
Get car.  Get car. negative.
We make love? negative.
Finder's keepers. negative.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over. negative.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench. negative.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time. negative.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play. negative.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes. negative.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me. negative.
No. At least I don't recall. negative.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them? negative.
Very early. Dawn. negative.
No. negative.
No. negative.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way. negative.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother. positive.
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb... negative.
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up... negative.
I'm in no mood for trouble! negative.
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me... negative.
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred. positive.
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch? negative.
Were there any calls? negative.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings. positive.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until... positive.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left. negative.
Did he say anything about my sister? negative.
Yes? negative.
Is something wrong? positive.
I was getting to that! negative.
What thing could we be in together? negative.
She haven't even called you? positive.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay? positive.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet? negative.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do. positive.
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. negative.
He didn't come back here? negative.
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on... positive.
In a hurry. negative.
Let's go see Al Chambers. positive.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam. negative.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper. positive.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside. negative.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting? negative.
Sorry. negative.
What? negative.
We could laze around here a while longer. negative.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it. negative.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! negative.
I can come down next week. negative.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall? positive.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available. negative.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do. positive.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... negative.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you? negative.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people. negative.
You go out... with friends? negative.
Why do you ask that? negative.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again. positive.
Except you. negative.
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace! positive.
Phoenix? negative.
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking. negative.
That's it. negative.
Is there? negative.
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest... negative.
May I see your license? negative.
We have a problem. negative.
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother? positive.
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you. negative.
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of... negative.
Barefaced. negative.
Just coming up to ring for you. positive.
Looking for me? negative.
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place... negative.
...Forty thousand dollars! negative.
They thought she'd be coming to me. negative.
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet. negative.
You didn't find anything. positive.
He's inherited a fortune. negative.
Gosh, you had me fooled. negative.
What made you steal? Are you hungry? negative.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once. negative.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night. positive.
Thousands? negative.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news. negative.
How do you do. negative.
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you? negative.
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power. negative.
What were you dreaming about? negative.
Your father? negative.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him! negative.
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you. negative.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon. positive.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you? negative.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you. negative.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear? negative.
But why? She's the best friend I've got. positive.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again? negative.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her. negative.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement. positive.
We'll be coming to the opening. negative.
But it was really my fault. positive.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask. positive.
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince. negative.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird? positive.
Meaning what? negative.
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that? negative.
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire? negative.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly. positive.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet. negative.
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ... negative.
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it. negative.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street. negative.
Let it go. negative.
What do you mean? negative.
No kiddin'? negative.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire. negative.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor. negative.
Call the Homicide Squad! negative.
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out? negative.
No kiddin'. negative.
He might get some publicity out of it. negative.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last? negative.
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about? negative.
I see. Was that all she said? positive.
You weren't going with her? negative.
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue. negative.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it. positive.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us! positive.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy. negative.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow. negative.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon. negative.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station? negative.
What was her name? negative.
I've been dreaming about you. negative.
Could be. negative.
Of what? negative.
Dysfunctional -- negative.
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time. negative.
I've been dreaming about this. negative.
I am in awe of it, Mother. negative.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil. negative.
But who were they? negative.
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft. negative.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe. positive.
Actually, I am, though. negative.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it. negative.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me. positive.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared. negative.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun. positive.
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook! negative.
Son, was Rose in your room last night? negative.
The new girl is here. negative.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff! negative.
I said ahhh-dam stuff. negative.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom. positive.
Let's go peep from the living room. negative.
I think she's gonna kiss him. positive.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening? negative.
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out! negative.
Now I can't see. What are they doing? negative.
Wow! Brrrother! negative.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting. positive.
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go? negative.
What's happening? negative.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that. negative.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had. negative.
How could that be, son? positive.
Is her husband sick or something? positive.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy? positive.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny. positive.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it? negative.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died? positive.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been. positive.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you. positive.
I am ahead of you. negative.
Of course. negative.
Turn up your hearing aid. negative.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do. positive.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother. negative.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going. negative.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it. positive.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children. negative.
Well, she's back. negative.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon. positive.
Now you listen to me, Rose -- negative.
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do. positive.
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house. positive.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension. negative.
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar? negative.
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her? negative.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do? negative.
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something. positive.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her! negative.
How is she? negative.
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time! positive.
Honey, he is Mr. Right. negative.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you? negative.
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this! negative.
Rose, what are you doing up? negative.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens. negative.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on. positive.
How can the buttons stand the pressure? negative.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose? negative.
You don't know where you're going? positive.
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too? positive.
Strange voices, Rose? negative.
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger? negative.
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that? negative.
Well, it was a silly question. negative.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes? negative.
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job! positive.
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state! negative.
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else. negative.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it. positive.
Galley what? negative.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him? positive.
Took your time gettin' here. negative.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit? positive.
What's the matter with him? negative.
Afraid of the hospital? negative.
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist? negative.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful. negative.
Mother... is Rose going to die? negative.
Yes, Ma'am. negative.
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose? negative.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him. positive.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something. positive.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already! negative.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?! negative.
You think it's that good? positive.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ? negative.
Who cares? negative.
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it. negative.
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide. negative.
Kittle... negative.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy. negative.
We should slow down. negative.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden? negative.
When you planning to cut back on that? negative.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender? negative.
Gimmie a butt. negative.
Happy Independence Day. negative.
Smooth move, hot-shot. negative.
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright. positive.
Can't I? negative.
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended. negative.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer. negative.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time. negative.
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time. negative.
Alright? negative.
Get closer!  Don't lose him! positive.
What... ?  Not you too? negative.
That's not true. negative.
How'd we do? negative.
Get his attention. negative.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all. negative.
What the hell's his problem? negative.
No more counting the big money for someone else. negative.
Oh, yeah... the explosion. negative.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. negative.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. negative.
Jabba's palace. negative.
What is thy bidding, my Master? negative.
I told you to remain on the command ship. negative.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things. positive.
Vader's on that ship. negative.
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. positive.
Hey! negative.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand! positive.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. negative.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. negative.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando. negative.
Well, look at you, a general, huh? positive.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years. positive.
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? negative.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. negative.
There it is! negative.
Ugh! negative.
Oh! negative.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. negative.
Over there! Two more of them! negative.
What do you remember? negative.
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. positive.
Yes. It's you Leia. negative.
Master Yoda, you can't die. negative.
Well, I'm sorry. negative.
Yes or no will do. negative.
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him. positive.
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never. positive.
He might be.  I don't know. positive.
It's as if we were glued to the spot. negative.
Yes. negative.
But it seems so unhealthy here. positive.
Brad... negative.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light. negative.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses. negative.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry. negative.
You're OK by me. negative.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles. positive.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this? negative.
What a guy negative.
Want to come again and stay negative.
Wheeling negative.
No no no, no no. negative.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet. negative.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane. negative.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated. negative.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What? negative.
Some people are very shy by nature. positive.
Would ya like a glass of water? negative.
It's only temporary. negative.
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it? positive.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either. negative.
...T-thank you. negative.
I always knew you was pretty. positive.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV? negative.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me? negative.
Don't you open them anymore? positive.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine? positive.
Is everything all right? negative.
...I dunno. negative.
No... I can't! negative.
Paulie, please -- negative.

Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!! positive.
You busted?! negative.
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy. negative.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight. negative.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best! positive.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man! positive.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth. negative.
How was the flight, Champ? negative.
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them. negative.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar. negative.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'. negative.
Nine minutes! negative.
That's ten bucks. negative.
...How 'bout for the Cokes? negative.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels. positive.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying. positive.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall -- positive.
What's ya name again? negative.
A hundred an' thirty. positive.
What about for food an' stuff? negative.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo. negative.
Ya sure? negative.
How'd you know? positive.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems. negative.
I feel bad about walkin'. negative.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side. negative.

Make your teeth yella -- negative.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'. positive.
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties -- positive.
Do you see me talkin'? Huh? positive.

More like thirty. positive.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much. positive.

So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much? positive.
I'll tear his head off. negative.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king. negative.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job! negative.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow. positive.
He's a riot. negative.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket. positive.
What was <u>that</u>? negative.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again. negative.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant? negative.
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried. positive.
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways. negative.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo. positive.
Does it hurt? negative.
So altruistic. negative.
You shot Roger. negative.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong. negative.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant? positive.
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up. positive.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous. negative.
When will I hear from you? negative.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black. negative.
Maybe.  Why? negative.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.? negative.
Well, everybody needs a hobby. positive.
You got the will in there, don't ya? negative.
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce. negative.
What the hell are you doin'? negative.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run? negative.
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder? negative.
How do you know that? positive.
Hey, don't I get an encore? negative.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request? negative.
Say, who's this guy laughin'? negative.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears? negative.
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother. positive.
I'll get it. negative.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club? positive.
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir. positive.
Quarrel sir! no, sir. negative.
No better? negative.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure. negative.
Romeo! Romeo! negative.
Is the day so young? negative.
Out-- negative.
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh? positive.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her. positive.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe. negative.
Good marrow, father! negative.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been negative.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. positive.
I come for my lady Juliet. negative.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once. positive.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help? positive.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need. positive.
[Within] Juliet! negative.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo? negative.
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him. positive.
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both. positive.
What? negative.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. negative.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? positive.
I take thee at thy word. positive.
By the hour of nine. negative.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone. negative.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again? negative.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm. negative.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age. negative.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah! negative.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. negative.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound. positive.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she! positive.
A most courteous exposition. negative.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA. positive.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing. positive.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again. negative.
This is important. positive.
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent? negative.
We kept it... negative.
I don't know. positive.
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking. negative.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous. negative.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks. positive.
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then? negative.
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers? negative.
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy. negative.
I still am. negative.
I better be getting that. negative.
Now, what did we steal? negative.
I'm a patriate. negative.
It's quite satifactory. negative.
We'll double your price. negative.
What do you mean? negative.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him. negative.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car. negative.
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together. negative.
So, you've got it all figured, do you? positive.
Sent it where? negative.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened. negative.
A means to an end, is that it? negative.
Then I guess we're set. negative.
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop? negative.
Soon. negative.
Created? negative.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future. positive.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit? positive.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard. negative.
Perhaps the police? negative.
I didn't know that you spoke French. positive.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that? negative.
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around. negative.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something. positive.
He's going back. negative.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital. negative.
Clearly. negative.
It is at that. positive.
I never made that claim. negative.
You would have done that? negative.
How could you have done that? negative.
They don't have the package. positive.
No you don't, and you know it. positive.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not? positive.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job. positive.
I told you, I quit. negative.
It's the Irish tape we want. negative.
Doing well.  This is? positive.
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you! positive.
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest? positive.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was. positive.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why! negative.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus! negative.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse? negative.
We'll torch the bases, how's that? negative.
I don't know... positive.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway. negative.
Well, we didn't know that at the time. positive.
I should have known something like this was going to happen! positive.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls. positive.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us. negative.
You're out of your mind. negative.
How long is it going to take?! negative.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up! negative.
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays. positive.
What happened?  What's Earl doing here? negative.
It's too late... negative.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours. negative.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that. negative.
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies. negative.
I'm all ears. negative.
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak. negative.
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement. negative.
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!! negative.
Whoa, Earl! negative.
Could it have been in the Mercedes? negative.
Yeah?  So? negative.
You got me something?  What's the occasion? positive.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore. positive.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time. negative.
You're worth every last penny. positive.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it. positive.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal. negative.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish... negative.
Yeah, I've seen him. negative.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here. negative.
Be more specific.  A month, a week... negative.
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying? negative.
What? negative.
What makes you say that? negative.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back. negative.
Don't you have to be here? negative.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them. positive.
Hello. negative.
I don't suppose you've seen her. positive.
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went? negative.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time... negative.
I'll settle for a third of that. negative.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches -- negative.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot. positive.
Hi ma. negative.
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details. negative.
That's great Earl! positive.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene. positive.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense. positive.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home. negative.
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there. positive.
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist? negative.
Wait. negative.
I got my sources. negative.
How'd you know? positive.
So tell me what you know. positive.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship. negative.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes. negative.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that? negative.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black. negative.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop. negative.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father? negative.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one. negative.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car. negative.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry? negative.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid? negative.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open. negative.
What'd I say? negative.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home. negative.
Hello. negative.
Well, hurry up. negative.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you. negative.
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit. negative.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw. negative.
I thought you'd think it was crazy. positive.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding. negative.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice? negative.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs? negative.
Are you okay? negative.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you. negative.
I think we should stop talking. positive.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you? negative.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her. negative.
How was the sex? negative.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu? negative.
Very nice. positive.
No Chinese man discovered electricity. positive.
Vegas... negative.
What is Mac out? negative.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move. negative.
Lee! negative.
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth? negative.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye. negative.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this. negative.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee. negative.
Is this a payoff? positive.
Put your arms around me. negative.
What's going on? negative.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there. negative.
Are you okay? negative.
I didn't know which side you were on. positive.
Do you still have the bills? negative.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand. positive.
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to... positive.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport -- negative.
Lee!  It's him! negative.
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert. negative.
And that, of course, would be me. negative.
Help me Rhonda. negative.
It's the same thing! negative.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit. negative.
-- what the hell is that? negative.
Right.... negative.
You make the plate? negative.
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened. negative.
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities. negative.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America. negative.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere. positive.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll! negative.
Want some? negative.
Excuse me? negative.
Like that. positive.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it. negative.
What a surprise! negative.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color? positive.
Not anymore. negative.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is? positive.
Jesus...what do you want? negative.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em. positive.
Yeah. So why you look do down? negative.
How much they want? positive.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason. negative.
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?! negative.
Yo, Johnson... negative.
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert! positive.
Hmmmm? negative.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop. negative.
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye. positive.
Where do we find him? positive.
Yes. negative.
Hello. negative.
Yes. negative.
He is very good. negative.

I am so sorry about your men. negative.
See you at the wedding. negative.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding. positive.
What do you expect me to say to this? negative.
Really? negative.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad. negative.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs. positive.
Of course. negative.
"Sink the putt." negative.
"Nothing but net." positive.
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you. positive.
Rub your ears. negative.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you. negative.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support. negative.
In vino veritas. negative.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate. negative.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess." negative.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track. positive.
Sorry, no.  I just got one. positive.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman. negative.
What? negative.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are? positive.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick. positive.
They made me put my hat back on. negative.
Everest.  Is that right? negative.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken. negative.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her? positive.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical. negative.

You look... uh... You look fine. negative.
I'll have the same. negative.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this? positive.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth. positive.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this? negative.
I already explained about that. negative.
Lost! negative.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there? negative.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me. negative.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot. negative.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up. negative.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming. positive.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady. negative.
What? negative.
A harmless joke. negative.
No, no.  You're her best friend. positive.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them. positive.
But it's on the water. positive.
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut -- negative.
Even when you were young? negative.
Who is it? negative.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth. positive.

About forever. negative.

Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you. positive.
Right. negative.

"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day." positive.
He lost all the weight... there. negative.
Can too. negative.
Plus he fell in love with a temp. negative.
Men never get this movie. negative.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows. negative.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye. negative.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it. negative.
You don't know who she was, Annie -- positive.
Becky? negative.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice -- positive.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him. negative.
Honey, he wasn't right for you. negative.
Howard. negative.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and -- positive.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental. positive.

Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while -- positive.
Hello. negative.
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more? negative.
What are you going to do, Sam? negative.
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late? negative.

You'll find out. positive.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat? negative.
Dad?  About last night? negative.
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know? positive.
Sure.  Looking good. negative.
How did they get our phone number? negative.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh? negative.
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex. negative.
Bye bye blackbird. negative.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die? positive.
Like do you believe in heaven? positive.
Great. positive.
It's a sign. negative.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building -- negative.
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed. positive.
Thank Victoria for dinner. negative.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho. negative.

To the mine? negative.
This water's cold again. positive.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union! negative.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it! negative.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me. negative.
What were they saying? About you? In there? negative.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes. positive.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh? negative.
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line? negative.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again. negative.
This is what we've been waiting for. negative.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions. negative.
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ... negative.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get. positive.

You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep? positive.
What does J.F.K. stand for? negative.

Really? negative.
You mean like the Donner Party? positive.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy? positive.

My sentiments exactly. negative.
You thinking what I'm thinking? negative.
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat. negative.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there. negative.

Yes, sir. negative.
Y'all come back. negative.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it. negative.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey... negative.

Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie? positive.
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen. negative.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?

Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir. positive.
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private? negative.

You think he really believed it? negative.
How fast? negative.
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about...

Be a little decent. negative.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here. negative.
Hi. negative.
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason. negative.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know. positive.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate? negative.
You're tough, J-man. negative.
Then what's love? negative.
C'mon, just do it. positive.

Did you sleep with her? positive.
No, you're not a guy. negative.
Wait a minute. negative.
Wait a minute. negative.

Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it. negative.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment. negative.

Have they found my father? positive.
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis. negative.
She's tough. negative.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around. positive.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house. negative.
That fish smelled strong. negative.
Where is she? negative.
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming. negative.

I heard screaming. negative.
For about two seconds. negative.

His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho. negative.
You're crazy -- both of you. negative.

Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there? negative.
What the hell's going on? negative.
A woman... negative.
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on. negative.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air. negative.

Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had. negative.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane. negative.
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient. negative.
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people. negative.

I know, I know... focusing on one little thing. positive.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy. negative.
What are you going to say? negative.
What are you talking about? negative.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here. positive.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out? negative.
Oh, you want to stay now? negative.
Because he is John Doe, by choice. negative.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now! negative.
Tell me it's not true. negative.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am. negative.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long. positive.
Perfect example. negative.

You ask her! negative.
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing... positive.
Ethan, quit it! negative.
They'll be back... positive.
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin... positive.

Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone? positive.
Martin, what- negative.
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go. negative.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him. positive.
Do I look like it that much? positive.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved! negative.
And that is? negative.
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police... negative.

It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?" negative.
Not ready? Where is she? negative.
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another? negative.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona. negative.
What do you love so much? negative.

So I'm saying it... negative.
I can't just let him stand by the door... positive.
-- Right after I sprayed her? negative.
Yeah! positive.
-- White ladies? negative.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better... positive.
-- took a bus. negative.
Jackie Shawn. negative.
Call me! negative.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots. negative.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone. negative.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen. negative.
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream. positive.
Now, George -- negative.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something. positive.
But in the same house, you know, one house. negative.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually... negative.
Jill, say hello to Felicia. positive.
Yeah, baby... negative.
Hey, I'm, you know -- negative.
Go where? negative.
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay? negative.
George. negative.
I already said hello. negative.
George. negative.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision. positive.
Egypt. negative.
No, but I think they might. positive.
What business meeting? negative.
You did fuck him, didn't you? negative.
That was him. negative.
Baby, please don't... I love you. negative.
... well I'm glad you told me. negative.
-- yes. negative.
George... negative.
No. negative.
Said what! negative.
But the important thing is you're successful at it. positive.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves. negative.
It's good you want to do something, George. negative.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute? negative.
Tonight? negative.
I know it, I know it. positive.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me -- positive.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight -- negative.
Sit down. negative.
I wanna hear about it, George. negative.
Why, why do you think that is? positive.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson! negative.
You really think so? negative.
All right, who're you with? Jill? negative.
 negative.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding. negative.
 negative.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like. positive.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much. positive.
Who were you talking to? negative.
They get hair all over the place. negative.
Here. negative.
No. negative.
-- you phony asshole -- negative.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along? negative.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman. positive.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side. positive.
It must be something. negative.
It's been so long I don't how long? negative.
I would say so, yes. negative.
What? negative.
But why Egypt? negative.
... my friend doesn't like it here either. positive.
Johnny! negative.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink -- negative.
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind? negative.
Are you married? negative.
Do you have something against traveling? positive.
No! negative.
We'll let you know tomorrow. positive.
Dad? negative.
Are you having a good time? positive.
Good.  I want you to have a good time. positive.
No I ain't. negative.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun. positive.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful. negative.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful. negative.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you? negative.
I won't make any noise. negative.
Red Rum. negative.
Mommy... negative.
No. negative.
To my stomach. negative.
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay? negative.
Please... negative.
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny. positive.
Won't keep you a moment, sir. negative.
Delbert Grady. negative.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do. positive.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long. positive.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch. positive.
Beg pardon? negative.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter. positive.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks. negative.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back. negative.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different. negative.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready. negative.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up. negative.
What do you want me to do about it? negative.
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work. negative.
I just want to go back to my room. positive.
Stay away from me. positive.
Give me the bat. negative.
I'm gonna go now. negative.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job. negative.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long. positive.
I'd better collect my family first. negative.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter. positive.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably. negative.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through. positive.
I don't want your money. You're a booger. positive.
Please, Uncle Al. negative.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows! negative.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a... negative.
Don't call me dear boy. negative.
Your mom's not around, is she? negative.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference? negative.
What is it? negative.
Was it a prescription? negative.
Well... was it a prescription? negative.
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face. negative.
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed. negative.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again! negative.
I saw what I saw. positive.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed. negative.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and- negative.
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you. positive.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention? negative.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED negative.
You know, I just might! positive.
But I'm fearful! negative.
And I'm tearful! negative.
His ashes? negative.
What? negative.
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say? negative.
You bastard! negative.
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God! negative.
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you. negative.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you? positive.
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this. negative.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money. negative.
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours. negative.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles. positive.
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work. positive.
What? negative.
Soprano or alto? positive.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again! positive.
Van Cartier. negative.
It's after five.  We have to bathe. negative.
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's? negative.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in? positive.
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me! negative.
Well, then there's only one thing to do. positive.
Mary Clarence! negative.
Oh my Lord! negative.
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING negative.
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell? negative.
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier. negative.
I see. negative.
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet? positive.
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin! negative.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast. positive.
Yeah? positive.
Sometimes it's not enough! negative.
So... hi there. negative.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself. negative.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself. positive.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task. negative.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals? negative.
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days. negative.
But -- why? negative.
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you. negative.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham? positive.
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing. negative.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take. negative.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can. positive.
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music! negative.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there? positive.
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime? negative.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them. negative.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips? positive.
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun? positive.
We could put you into our witness protection program. negative.
He's so damn cocky.  This is different. negative.
Joey? negative.
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry? negative.
It should be here any minute. negative.
Peace on Earth. negative.
Mary Clarence!  Sister! negative.
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her! negative.
Mary Clarence -- you're alive! negative.
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were? negative.
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere. positive.
But, Bishop... positive.
She's a nun, Vince. negative.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman? positive.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse. negative.
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts? negative.
We must be a curious sight to him. negative.
He is a behemoth. negative.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you. negative.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut. negative.
It is sacrilege! negative.
Your superiors are two days away! positive.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night. negative.
May we look at them now? negative.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts. negative.
Very few, if any. negative.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next... positive.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth. negative.
What is it? negative.
Thank you. negative.
What is it? negative.
We should not go much further in this murk. positive.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you. negative.
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet? negative.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate. positive.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts? positive.
What can we do? negative.
What now? negative.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business. positive.
My suitor? negative.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black. negative.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage. negative.
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic. positive.
Thank you.  No.  Here... positive.
People have put their trust in you. negative.
What are you on about? negative.
She is not your birth mother, is she? negative.
Blood. negative.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside? negative.
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself. negative.
Ichabod... negative.
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower? negative.
Can you help? negative.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move. negative.
You... you are alive. negative.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge? negative.
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go. positive.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good. negative.
Thank ye. negative.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness. positive.
Well, what did you want? negative.
Well, I guess it's all good. negative.
Yeah. positive.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world. negative.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy? negative.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet. negative.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'. negative.
Leave. negative.
How'd your baptizin' go? negative.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch? negative.
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me! negative.
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time. negative.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here. negative.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you. negative.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home. positive.
You got that shit right. negative.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her. negative.
I want to be baptized. negative.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess. negative.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of. negative.
What are all them books? negative.
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl? positive.
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off? negative.
They still around, your folks? positive.
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then. positive.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store. positive.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all. positive.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me? negative.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone. positive.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me. positive.
It was fun, anyhow. positive.
Yeah, I guess. negative.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama. negative.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it. negative.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here. negative.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it. negative.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama? positive.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think. positive.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go? negative.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that. positive.
I'm ye boy. negative.
I ain't got nothing but them books. negative.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out? positive.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history. positive.
Yeah. positive.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'? negative.
Well, okay. I got you some. negative.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow. negative.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either. positive.
I don't think I've ever seen you before. positive.
Do you have family here? negative.
Yes sir. negative.
Naw, I ain't. negative.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually. positive.
He just got out of the state hospital. negative.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him. negative.
What about me? negative.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night. negative.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table. positive.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you? negative.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee? negative.
I didn't mean that. positive.
Will he be supervised? positive.
And your father? Is he from New York? negative.
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis? negative.
Wow. You don't fool around, do you? positive.
Melville, huh?  It's been a while. negative.
Not an easy book. negative.
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it. positive.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming. positive.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay? negative.
What about for you? negative.
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth. negative.
Are you closed? negative.
Looks like someone forgot a camera. negative.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter. negative.
I'd like to see your pictures some day. negative.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project? negative.
What do you mean? negative.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone? negative.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie. negative.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you? negative.
So what did he say when he called? negative.
Hey, man, how's it going? negative.
You usually get two. negative.
So. Are we ready? negative.
Did you ever go back to see her? positive.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it. negative.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred. negative.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin? negative.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it? positive.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name. positive.
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill. negative.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you. positive.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something. positive.
She looks just like you. positive.
So you're just going to give up and go home? positive.
Still, you can't just write her off. positive.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs. positive.
What's this? negative.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber. positive.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong. positive.
How long you been working for me, Auggie? negative.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for? positive.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you. negative.
Open it. negative.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy? negative.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out. negative.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister. negative.
I just want to know where he is. positive.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place? positive.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is. negative.
No thank you. negative.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill. positive.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead." negative.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me. negative.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself. negative.
Benefits? negative.
You named the kid after yourself, huh? negative.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis. negative.
Aren't you going to say anything? negative.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle. negative.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up. negative.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne. negative.
Mostly what. negative.

Three nights. negative.

Ah, coffee. Smells good. negative.
Thanks. negative.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late. positive.

I don't know. positive.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you. negative.
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod. negative.

From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's. negative.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up? negative.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one. positive.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts? negative.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story? negative.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you? negative.

What for, Sheriff? negative.
White or black? positive.

You think that <u>is</u> the truth. positive.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in? positive.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there? negative.
Well... negative.
Is it possible? negative.
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was. positive.
Can I say something, here? negative.

Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit? negative.
I beg your pardon. negative.
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls. negative.
No --- how does it go? positive.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join? negative.
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together. negative.
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it? negative.
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows? negative.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia. positive.
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand? negative.
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there? negative.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards. negative.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country. negative.
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish - positive.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere. negative.
You know - the old shell game. positive.
What message?  What motorboat? negative.
Oh, he does! negative.
WHAT? negative.
Jerry!  You can't be serious! negative.
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy? positive.
Jerry - there's another problem. positive.
Hey - these are real diamonds. positive.
That's some nerve! negative.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him. negative.

Telephone call?  Who's got time for that? negative.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet? negative.
Did you hear that? negative.
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine. positive.
She sings, too. negative.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele - negative.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out. negative.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over. negative.
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl - negative.
I'm a very sick girl. negative.
I'm not that sick. negative.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey. negative.

Anything this time? positive.
Good night. negative.

You're wasting the taxpayers' money. negative.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one. negative.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing. positive.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue? negative.
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie. negative.
You know what I love about all this? negative.
Perfect. All ginny. negative.

What does your gut say? negative.
Have you ever done anything like this before? positive.
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead. negative.
Sorry. Im a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me. positive.
You shit! negative.
Its hard to explain. negative.

She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school. positive.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy. negative.
When you read it we'll talk about it... negative.

If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it! negative.

I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh? negative.
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal... negative.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think? negative.

Who are you, kid? negative.
Purpre mama! negative.

So... We must free more Canadian prizoners? negative.
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe. negative.
It's okay, I am done for. negative.
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy? positive.

Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand. negative.
Stan, I never cared for Gregory. negative.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b> positive.
Excuse me? negative.
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery. positive.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests. negative.
Why, didn't they say? positive.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?. negative.
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?! negative.
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right? negative.

Break it down to me, what's going on? negative.
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for? negative.
Everyone just stay put. positive.

Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation. positive.
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem. positive.
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly. positive.
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed? negative.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee. negative.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli? negative.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right? negative.
Sorry about your loss. negative.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball. negative.
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you. negative.
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin? positive.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space? positive.
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling. positive.
It's a beautiful thing. negative.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day. positive.
What do you think I can do? positive.
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass. positive.
Who gave it to you? negative.
Who are you? Who sent you here? negative.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz. positive.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan. positive.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner. negative.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town. negative.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour? negative.
It could just as easily have been me in that box. positive.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing. positive.
My poor baby! negative.
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born. negative.
Uh...over easy. negative.
What did you do to Buzz? negative.
Junior. negative.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior. negative.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list. negative.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy. positive.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you. positive.
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank. negative.
After we eat, Dad. negative.
Like this? positive.
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke! negative.
I'm a bowler. negative.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die. negative.
Mind if I cut in? negative.
Do you have a boyfriend? positive.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl? negative.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man. negative.
Come on, bargain with me. negative.
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming? positive.
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it. negative.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm. negative.
You told Junior that we did it. negative.
He's dead Sheila. negative.
Can I come with you? positive.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both. positive.
Theo, Buzz is dead. negative.
You're really pissing me off. negative.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you? positive.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night. negative.
Some unfinished business. negative.
Very good, busyboy. negative.

They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs. negative.
In basic English, what does all this mean? negative.
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before. positive.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team. negative.
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears. negative.
Nobody move. negative.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before. negative.
But you've tested it? positive.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting. negative.
Anything else? negative.
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight. negative.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite? negative.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash? negative.
Maybe older -- positive.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me. negative.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration. negative.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail. negative.
They pressurize us with helium. positive.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir. negative.
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run." negative.
You don't think weapons are important? positive.
You think he killed Edmunds? positive.
I see it. negative.
Any sign of Harry? negative.
Nothing, sir. negative.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now... negative.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped. positive.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely. positive.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind. negative.
I have to tell you.  It's strange. positive.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television. positive.
I'd also like it noted -- negative.
Some sort of lead or something. negative.
What's wrong? negative.
It won't register.  It's too big to image. negative.
Resetting the sub. negative.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this. positive.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson? negative.
Norman! negative.
Wait a minute. negative.
... He lied to us.  He left us down here. negative.
In Edmunds' things. positive.
Don't tell me to calm down! negative.
Beth -- negative.
Four days? negative.
But I don't know how -- positive.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad. negative.
The refridgerator. negative.
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him. positive.
He translated it wrong. negative.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid... negative.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real. negative.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness. negative.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol? negative.
It's like a sleeping pill? positive.
Three to six hours. negative.
It's an idea. negative.
Not believing you. negative.
What's wrong, Norman? negative.
It's getting cold. negative.
But -- positive.
I never went in that sphere. negative.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry. negative.
Don't, Beth. negative.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things. negative.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage. negative.
Where is it coming from, Beth? negative.
Stop it! negative.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge. negative.
Pussy. negative.
Well, what's your theory? negative.
He doesn't wait for an answer. negative.
Just in time, too. positive.
What? negative.
Why are you looking at me like that? positive.
I don't follow you. negative.
What is that?  That noise? negative.
You remember opening the door? negative.
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87? negative.
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming. positive.
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it -- negative.
What is it? negative.
How much time you figure to get to the surface? negative.
Missed. negative.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three -- negative.
You know how to work this thing? positive.
Well, press something! positive.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away? negative.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't... positive.
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious. positive.
Why would this ship carry instructions in English? positive.
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch. positive.
Meaning it didn't land in the water. negative.
What'd you say? negative.
How are the others? negative.
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant. positive.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it. negative.
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things. positive.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation. negative.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect. negative.
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline? negative.
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman. negative.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then? negative.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time. positive.
No, not anymore. negative.
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault. negative.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward. negative.
You have your father's style.  You've done very well. negative.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything. negative.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important. negative.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years. positive.
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you. positive.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through. negative.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder? positive.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else? positive.
What do I do? positive.
What is it? negative.
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases. positive.
Of course, where you been kid? negative.
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on. negative.
Here come six more... grid two! negative.
I found it... It's just not there. negative.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way... positive.
Watch it!  Move back. positive.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide... positive.
No!... negative.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin? positive.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go. negative.
See Threepio... do you copy? positive.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on? negative.
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service. negative.
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies. negative.
You rich kids... are all the same ! negative.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year... negative.
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together. negative.
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...? negative.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know. positive.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ? negative.
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir. negative.
Don't think about it... go on instinct. positive.
You always told me you couldn't do human... positive.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up. negative.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever. positive.
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here. negative.
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen. negative.
She's flying starships ! negative.
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical positive.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak. negative.
I love you, Carmen. negative.
You talk to Carl ? negative.
What happened to your hair ? negative.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead ! positive.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K. negative.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again. positive.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...! negative.
A lot can happen in three minutes. negative.

Hey, Rico, wanna dance ? negative.
You still gonna play for Brazil ? positive.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky. negative.
It stinks, you goin. negative.
Diz, see what you can do. positive.
What frequency ? negative.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really. negative.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ? positive.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ? negative.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader ! negative.
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ? negative.
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ? positive.
Well, of course you should come home immedietly ! negative.
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl. positive.
Alright, we're gonna carry you... negative.
Mister Rasczak ? negative.
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics. negative.
AAAAAAAAAAAA ! negative.
Where is Lt. Ilia? negative.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead? negative.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator. positive.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...? negative.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator. negative.
'To learn all that is learnable.' negative.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you? negative.
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...! positive.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew... negative.
... but I still recommend further simulation study. positive.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded? negative.
You saved the ship. negative.
Granted. negative.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...? negative.
<U>Computer off</U>! negative.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...! negative.
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately. negative.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away. positive.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too. negative.
Forward motion, Captain...! negative.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. negative.
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now! negative.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu. negative.
One hundred kilometers... negative.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now! negative.
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that... positive.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral... negative.
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain... negative.
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview. negative.
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here. negative.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud. positive.
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain. negative.
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain. negative.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...? negative.
They had a pattern to follow... negative.
Spock? Concerned about his chances? negative.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images... negative.
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful! negative.
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns... positive.
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott? negative.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun. negative.
The people in New Hampshire. positive.

I read for that part.  Did pretty good too. negative.
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot; negative.
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple. negative.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen? negative.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us? negative.
So why are you asking me? negative.
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual... negative.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara... positive.
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse. negative.
That happens.  To families. negative.
I hope it's the right kind. negative.
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself. positive.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m... negative.
I could help with the debate. positive.
You don't like his friends. positive.
This'll work, huh? positive.
Annabelle...wake up honey... negative.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad. negative.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter. negative.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch. negative.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today. negative.
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother. negative.
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play. positive.
Oh, baby, I'm so sor... negative.

I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what? negative.
That I do.  Always will. positive.
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son? negative.
Mommy's sick, guys. negative.
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad. positive.

That's necessary, huh? negative.
Which part of no don't you understand? positive.
Me too. negative.
Our children. negative.
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes -- negative.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there. negative.
Yet another spaghetti night. negative.

It's just not the right time t... negative.
And I'm going to win. negative.

Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis. negative.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor. negative.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going? negative.

We used pull. negative.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today? negative.
Ready for tomorrow? negative.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine. positive.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy. positive.
I dunno. negative.
So? How was school today? negative.
Get the hell outta here! negative.
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner. positive.
Come here, give me a hug! negative.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all. negative.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that. negative.
No, not really. negative.
Who is this? negative.
I believe it. negative.

Yeah...So you're um...you're married? negative.
OK. Bye. negative.
Pretty cool, Stanley. negative.
You want some? negative.
What for? negative.
So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out. positive.
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now. negative.
Now what? negative.
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight! negative.
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all... negative.
I have a lighter! negative.
How well do you know this place? positive.
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances... negative.
I insist... negative.
And what exactly do they intend to do? negative.
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified! positive.
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront... negative.
How goes the roll call? negative.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out. negative.
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world... negative.
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean? positive.
Are we adrift-- negative.
They must have got their hands on a test vial! positive.
I have your word, Mister President? negative.
What's the meaning of this? negative.
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years. negative.
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon? positive.
That's nonsense, and you know it! positive.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie. negative.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing? positive.
Give that back to me. negative.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country? negative.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they? negative.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. negative.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again? negative.
Get a grip on yourself, Major! negative.
Do you have any witnesses, Major? positive.
What about the President? negative.
So what? negative.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz. negative.
Yes! negative.
Well, Mister President. negative.
General Schmuck? negative.
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ??? negative.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops. negative.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking. negative.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we? negative.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls. positive.
Are you trying to be insubordinate? positive.
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing. negative.
Are you hard of hearing, Major? negative.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details. positive.
Are you questioning my orders, Major? negative.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General? positive.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R? negative.
That about right? negative.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought. positive.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about. positive.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country. negative.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament? negative.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won. positive.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing. negative.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack. negative.
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group. negative.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir. positive.
He says they've only shot down three planes. positive.
Yes? negative.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight. positive.
What else could it be? negative.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders. positive.
Just the missiles. positive.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock. positive.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh. negative.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time. negative.
No, this looks like the real thing. positive.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad. negative.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around. negative.
Shoot, Lothar. negative.
That's what I said. negative.
Where'd they get you? negative.
How do you know he's dead? negative.
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam. positive.
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake." positive.
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it. negative.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114. negative.
Then that settles it, doesn't it? negative.
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose. positive.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it? positive.
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay? negative.
Maybe the warning system's out. positive.
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact? positive.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in? negative.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit. negative.
We are? negative.
Mn-hm. negative.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink. negative.
Can I have some? negative.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking. negative.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title? negative.
Typical male. negative.
Uh, home, you know. positive.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming? negative.
Your a nurse? negative.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know? negative.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie. negative.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars. positive.
Pony's coming here to the corner?! negative.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo. positive.
Jesus Christ. negative.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon? negative.
That sounds so depressing. positive.
A long, long, long, long, while. positive.
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze? negative.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze? negative.
Sure. negative.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady. positive.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean... positive.
Oh, and guess who showed up. negative.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica? negative.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say? negative.
Wait. Hey, man. negative.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit. negative.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man. negative.
Ah, you know people there? positive.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it. negative.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off. positive.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun. positive.
So, then, you're, like, available? positive.
Hey! Hey. negative.
It's okay. negative.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here. negative.
You're a drunk and an idiot. negative.
Whoa! negative.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh. negative.
You could do it. positive.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel? positive.
You okay, man? You okay? negative.
Will you stand up for me? negative.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on. negative.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica. negative.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony. negative.
I'd love to read that. negative.
Um, mother-daughter. negative.
Uh-huh. negative.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same. positive.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead? negative.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us. positive.
Tim, what are you talking about? negative.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places? positive.
What'd you do? negative.
You lied to me. negative.
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser. negative.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick. positive.
Jeff, stay there. negative.
Why we're just standing here. negative.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life... positive.
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she? positive.
Can I talk? negative.
Okay, what would you have done. negative.
What? negative.
What feelings? negative.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes? negative.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come. negative.
What? negative.
Oh, yeah? negative.
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know. positive.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not? negative.
You're unbelievable. negative.
Do your covers and all that shit. negative.
Yeah. positive.
Really? negative.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh... positive.
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house? positive.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too. negative.
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know. positive.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff? positive.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes. negative.
No, this has everything to do with you. positive.
Pony, oh my god! negative.
Yeah? positive.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York. positive.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint. positive.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want. negative.
Would I get paid? negative.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be" positive.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past. positive.
You know, my mom has this saying. positive.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash." negative.
"See what's around you listen to their lies" negative.
Where's Erica? You seen her? negative.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say? negative.
Yeah. positive.
What are you going to do? Hm? negative.
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh? negative.
Just one? positive.
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you? positive.
Hey, your gonna regret this. positive.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax! negative.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole. negative.
I'm going out later. negative.
The fuck not? negative.
Another sex dream? positive.
Diane?  Diane! negative.
Positive. negative.
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?" negative.
I know, but that was before. positive.
I'm sorry. negative.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat! negative.
Oh no... negative.
Yeah? positive.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns. positive.
You want us to help you pick up? negative.
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises. negative.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands? negative.
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals. negative.
Really... negative.
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm. negative.
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes... negative.
I'm only allowed "G" movies. negative.
All of you! negative.
Your help. negative.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it. negative.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special. negative.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm! negative.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough? negative.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille. negative.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours? negative.
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you? negative.
You forgot this. positive.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little? negative.
Well.... negative.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer. negative.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you. negative.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you. positive.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec. negative.
What about all those ideas you had? negative.
Check. negative.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ... negative.
I'm all tied up.  I can't. negative.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town. positive.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out. negative.

I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases. negative.
I'll say.  This is solid gold. positive.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting. positive.
May I say you smell real special. positive.
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here. negative.
You bet. negative.
Hello, young fellow. negative.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table. positive.
What's the matter, Norma? negative.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture... negative.
Are you or aren't you? positive.
And you have written pictures, haven't you? negative.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages? negative.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it. positive.
It's getting kind of late -- negative.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties. negative.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things. negative.
I want to talk to you for a minute. negative.
They've come for my car. positive.
I need some money right now. negative.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here? negative.
You're really going to send it to De Mille? negative.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts. positive.

What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours? negative.

Joseph C. Gillis? negative.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture. negative.
Haven't got a thing. positive.
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury? negative.
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs. negative.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important. negative.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners. positive.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max? negative.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon. negative.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall. negative.
What does it mean? negative.
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game? negative.
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK? negative.
I don't feel like it right now. negative.
What's happening? negative.
Don't leave me. negative.
Like it? positive.
Let's talk about us, not her. negative.
We're from different worlds. negative.
Is this how? negative.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her. negative.
She said it wouldn't last. negative.
Away. From you. positive.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think? positive.
Wait. Don't leave me. negative.
She's right. They'll string her up. negative.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs. positive.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you. positive.
No! negative.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat. negative.
What about my proposal? negative.
She did that deliberately. negative.
How'd you do that? negative.
No thanks. You go on. positive.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you. negative.
Lucy; come back! negative.
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car. negative.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop. negative.
Don't you believe in knocking? negative.
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it. positive.
I just did. Because I have the Power. positive.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning. positive.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that? positive.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena. positive.
Where is inner space? negative.

Are you happy, Zaltar? negative.
Then teach me how. positive.
You're going to take me back? negative.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail. negative.
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya? negative.
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row. positive.

And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often. negative.
Peanut butter and jelly. negative.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there? negative.

Dishwasher? Any luck? negative.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . . positive.
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax! positive.
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'? negative.
Gus? negative.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice. negative.
Man, what is this? negative.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it. positive.
And do nothing. Just sit there. positive.
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!! positive.
The picture looks blurry. negative.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean? negative.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything. positive.
I don't know you, lady. positive.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage... negative.
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace. positive.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems: negative.
I can't! It's out of control! negative.
By hand. Like the pioneers did. positive.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work! negative.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician? negative.
I don't kiss. negative.
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather. negative.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it. negative.
Lois, what are you doing? negative.

This way Lex. positive.
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page. positive.

You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream. negative.
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility -- positive.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that - negative.

Yes, but will you honor it? negative.
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . .. negative.
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness. negative.
He's captured Non! negative.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful... negative.
They make my eyes itch. negative.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials. negative.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time. negative.
That sounds kind of pessimistic. positive.
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds. negative.
Gee, I don't think . . . positive.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie? negative.
Gee, I'm really sorry. negative.
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . . positive.

Where's Clark? negative.
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair! positive.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part. negative.

Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband. negative.
You think he'll find us. positive.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear? negative.
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis? negative.
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar? negative.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun. negative.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains. negative.
I'll deal with you later. positive.
But . . . how could you beat him? positive.
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  -- positive.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess. negative.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job? positive.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip. positive.
Super...man. Hmmm... negative.
Besides that. negative.
What can I tell you? He's my leader. negative.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.' positive.

Sort of. negative.
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say? negative.
Luthor  -- negative.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast! negative.
Ally.  That's right. negative.
And what does he do again? negative.
Yes...fine. negative.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay. negative.
Alison. negative.
My name is... negative.
I understand. negative.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do. negative.
Case? negative.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'? negative.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel. positive.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away... positive.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money. positive.
Have you been waiting long? negative.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough. positive.
Because I have to. negative.
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him. positive.
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia. negative.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring. negative.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way. negative.
What do you mean? negative.
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then? negative.
You've talked to Billy? negative.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley. positive.
Away from your crazy Mom. negative.
Is he coming over now?  Right away? negative.
It's like a song. negative.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished. negative.
Dolores. negative.
I have no questions. positive.
When? negative.
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on. positive.
You always think you're prepared for these things. positive.
Yes, I'll accept the charges. positive.
News? negative.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe. negative.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want. positive.
I can hear you breathing, Daddy. negative.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish? negative.
So you're just the thing we need. negative.
Are you expensive? negative.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement. negative.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house? negative.
Yes. negative.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this? negative.
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll? negative.
There wasn't time? positive.
What do you remember about the accident? negative.
Do you like the colour? positive.
The door needs a lock. negative.
Nothing good on your T.V.? negative.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton. positive.
He's somewhere... negative.
I still think he's responsible for the smear. positive.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth. negative.
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis. positive.
If looks could kill, I'm dead... negative.
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly. negative.
Sidney is a liar! negative.
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight. positive.
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table... negative.
I know Manny Davis. positive.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me. negative.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so... negative.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column... positive.
Uh huh. negative.
And who's feet is she on now? negative.
What does that mean - integrity? negative.
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard! negative.
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom. negative.
Sidney, I told you - positive.
Talk to her, Sidney... negative.
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth! positive.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do? positive.
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned. negative.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice. positive.
I don't think so. positive.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...? negative.
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"? positive.
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house? negative.
Do you think you could do something, Sidney? positive.
What would you think of me if - negative.
You ought to be used to me by now. negative.
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what? negative.
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth! negative.
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter! negative.
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...? negative.
We stick in each others craw. negative.
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help. negative.
I didn't do anything! positive.
J.J., if you think - negative.
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he? negative.
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around... positive.
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...? negative.
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did. negative.
Steve, I... negative.
You going to work all day? negative.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes? negative.
Please... let... the kids... go... negative.
My God. positive.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal? negative.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy! positive.
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people! positive.
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't! negative.
Everything. negative.
Does it hurt? negative.
Not even of dying? positive.
Is it dead? negative.
It must end here... or I am the future. positive.
It, John.  Not him.  It. negative.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again. positive.
I got it.  Piece of cake. negative.
John, get out of the way!! negative.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah. positive.
You broke my arm! negative.
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me! positive.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation. negative.
The CPU from the first terminator. positive.
Are you afraid? negative.
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it? negative.
What does he mean, too correct? negative.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need. positive.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased? negative.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.' negative.
I'm very sorry. negative.
You bet. negative.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect? negative.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being. negative.
Let Furtwängler go. Please. negative.
You live here, in Berlin? negative.
You do shorthand and typing? negative.
Major, Major... he's here ... negative.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major. negative.
Did you call someone you knew? negative.
Why were they going to arrest you? negative.
Steve Arnold... negative.
Who? negative.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical. positive.
What telegram? negative.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists. negative.
Then you are wrong. negative.
I have no idea. positive.
I have illegitimate children. negative.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things? positive.
How can I know such a thing? positive.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist? positive.
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwängler today? negative.
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th. positive.
Do I know Hans Hinkel? positive.
Yes, you remember. negative.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out. negative.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off. negative.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major? negative.
I've remembered something else... negative.
And ask him about his private life. negative.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler. negative.
Oh! The evening before, I see... negative.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one. negative.
You were in insurance before the war. negative.
Yes, Chuck? negative.
Mission control to Chuck, come in... negative.
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay. negative.
Anything else? negative.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be? negative.
You can't to that... negative.
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell. negative.
Alright, the beige one. negative.
You must have a girlfriend. negative.
Just let me go. positive.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him. positive.
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here? positive.
You volunteered? negative.
You'll learn. negative.
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage. negative.
What's that? negative.
Hot dogs? negative.
Not possible. negative.
He'll find us, won't he? negative.
A girl.  You know. positive.
And so you feel nothing. negative.
I bet you're ticklish. negative.
I don't think I like this. positive.
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom? negative.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me. positive.
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands. negative.
Same shit. negative.
Go!  Go!  He's got her. negative.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything. positive.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that? negative.
What? negative.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense. positive.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water. positive.
Pardon me... Miss... ? negative.
What's with him? negative.
This can't be real... negative.
I was trying to tell you... it's a game. negative.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away... negative.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to. negative.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there? negative.
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened... negative.
You deserted me. negative.
There goes a thousand dollars. positive.
That's classic. negative.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke. negative.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again. positive.
What is it? negative.
Where'd you get this? negative.
Okay. negative.
What are you doing... ? negative.
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead... negative.
Then, what good are you? negative.
Get us out of here... negative.
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank. negative.
What the fuck are you... ? negative.
It's mine... negative.
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration... negative.
Like what... my favorite color... ? negative.
Julliard, yeah. positive.
No. negative.
Hey there, Nickie. positive.
About me? negative.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito. negative.
You need anything? negative.
Who? negative.
It's them.  They did this. positive.
The phone's dead. negative.
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense! negative.
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop! positive.
Where's Christine?  The waitress. negative.
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you. positive.
We provide whatever's lacking. negative.
Physical? negative.
Get rid of them. negative.
Goddamnit, why do they do that? negative.
You know, these fit... perfectly. positive.
I've been so lonely. negative.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous. negative.
Thank you. negative.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else? positive.
Goodnight.  See you home. positive.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit... negative.
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser. negative.
Your ex-wife. negative.
What? negative.
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business... negative.
Hey... ! negative.
I wasn't expecting you. negative.
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services. negative.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me. positive.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon. negative.
I only saw Theo drive up. negative.
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting. positive.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think. positive.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself. negative.
Well, this lot is full! positive.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting? negative.
Yeah. positive.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim. negative.
Like she smelled it too? negative.
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me. positive.
Come on. negative.
What'll happen to us, Nell? negative.
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it. negative.
What happened? negative.
Get a blanket! negative.
Oh God, we can't get out! negative.
Is there something about the house? negative.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you? negative.
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper. negative.
No. negative.
Good night, Theo. negative.
David. negative.
Theo... Did you? negative.
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current -- negative.
As soon as you get dressed. negative.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars. positive.
Italian? negative.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian. negative.
I like the colors. positive.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive. positive.
We think someone is here. positive.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge. positive.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am. positive.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up. negative.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now. negative.
Huh? negative.
Oh really?  Where you from? negative.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability. negative.
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you. negative.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself? negative.
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos. positive.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops? positive.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend. positive.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her. positive.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate. positive.
Huh? negative.
What? negative.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it. negative.
Steady on. negative.
Too easy? negative.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time? positive.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses. negative.
Weren't you on a television series? negative.
Said it went on for donkey's years. negative.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean. negative.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed. positive.
I might've been away for the weekend. positive.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it? negative.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said. negative.
-- Your employer? negative.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren? positive.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks. positive.
On what.  What makes you so certain. negative.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess. positive.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you? positive.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod. negative.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO. negative.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke. negative.
Fancy it? negative.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying. positive.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money. positive.
A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client. negative.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money. positive.
Yeah, that's right. positive.
How much. positive.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow. positive.
What? negative.
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong. negative.
Is Valentine here? negative.
Hello there. negative.
Is he here? negative.
In a couple of days this whole thing -- positive.
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this. negative.
What. negative.
...I'm so sorry about your loss. negative.
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink? negative.
Yeah. positive.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand. positive.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words. positive.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane. negative.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are? positive.
...I wanted to make you happy. negative.
...No, please. negative.
...You are ze fahzer? negative.
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music? negative.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul! negative.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop? negative.
You got the dough?! negative.
Sure. negative.
...Was that a pass? negative.
Right! Strictly business. negative.
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh? positive.
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion. negative.
...Were you in the service, Ed? negative.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway? positive.
Uh-huh. negative.
How much to they want, Dave? positive.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing. negative.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money? negative.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it. negative.
Honey. negative.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them. positive.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back? negative.
...I don't get it. negative.
Not guilty, your honor... negative.
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender. positive.
Taking it seriously. negative.
That was quite something. positive.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane. negative.
Jesus... negative.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think. negative.
Frank. negative.
...You ever wonder about it? negative.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away. positive.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together! negative.
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me. negative.
Huh? negative.
Mr...? negative.
Doesn't bother me. negative.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege? negative.
He's a barber. negative.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law. negative.
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait. negative.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me. negative.
I'll go down and speak to him. negative.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help! positive.
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches. negative.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles. negative.
Battery's dead.  Shit. negative.
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools. negative.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?! negative.
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art. positive.
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board. positive.
If you don't mind, this could be important. positive.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework". negative.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger? positive.
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit. positive.
This place is a maze. positive.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real! negative.
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear. negative.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant? negative.
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit. positive.
Margo, these aren't seed pods. negative.
Like the claw. positive.
What's going on? negative.
I'm coming with you. negative.
Something tried to get into this room! positive.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum! positive.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide? negative.
What's that? negative.
You work here? positive.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are. positive.
This room sucks. positive.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow. negative.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded. negative.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it? negative.
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones! positive.
Got to finish this thesis sometime. positive.
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead? negative.
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed. negative.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims. negative.
I don't understand. negative.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit. positive.
Where would we find it? negative.
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark. negative.
They're all heavily armed. negative.
Genetic damage? negative.
Pendergast?  Are you all right? negative.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger. positive.
That was D'Agosta. negative.
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean? negative.
Then it won't go after the others? negative.
For what? negative.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion? negative.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there? positive.
What happened down there? negative.
Give me a shot from Truman's ring. positive.
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation? negative.
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves. negative.
Are we talking Emmies? negative.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that? positive.
Nothing was real. negative.
How can they have a child? positive.
Why not? negative.
Lauren, right? negative.
Actually, I'm free Sunday. negative.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow. positive.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon. negative.
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time. positive.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big. negative.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow. positive.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing. negative.
What's that? negative.
How did it go today? negative.
It'd be an adventure. negative.
What did you want? negative.
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough? negative.
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk. positive.
Arrah! negative.
--we need more charcoal. negative.
That's right.  I do, don't I? positive.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree? positive.
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own! negative.
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear. positive.
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you? negative.
How are you, Mother? negative.
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country. negative.
We ought to be getting you back, Mother. positive.
They're going to stop me talking to you. negative.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan-- positive.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared. positive.
Do you live around here? positive.
What am I doing here? positive.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting -- negative.
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully -- positive.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime -- positive.
You've got something to show me. positive.
This man's still alive. negative.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates? negative.
And if it's unsuccessful? negative.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken. negative.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence? positive.
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil? negative.
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found. negative.
Do I know you? positive.
You follow me out here for a reason? negative.
How'd you find me? negative.
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau -- negative.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states. positive.
What was it? negative.
What killed those men? negative.
How can I reach you? negative.
You've been using me -- negative.
You didn't know my father -- positive.
I'm on the roof. negative.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street. positive.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic. negative.
Where are you, Mulder? negative.
Something's not right... negative.
What? What are you talking about? negative.
It's like jelly. positive.
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too. negative.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by. positive.
You said you weren't coming? negative.
He didn't mention a park. negative.
Where would they be going? negative.
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself. negative.
This virus -- it... positive.
Been where? negative.
Scully....? negative.
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers -- negative.
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down. negative.
We're going to the morgue. negative.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization. positive.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in. positive.
Are we being watched? negative.
What is it? negative.
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs. positive.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future. positive.
I'd be there for him. negative.
Don't bring it home in this. positive.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened? negative.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so. negative.
...give a kiss to Edward. negative.
What then? negative.
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy? negative.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse." positive.
COME ON! negative.
That went well. negative.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work. negative.
She the one from Santa Cruz? negative.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place? negative.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke. negative.
Intravenous administration complete. negative.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation. negative.
What about the legalities of this...? negative.
Into Stargher.  Inside... negative.
How's the patient. negative.
How is she? negative.
Here he is. negative.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove? negative.
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere. positive.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it. negative.
Ich weiss nicht. negative.
Warscheinlich ist der murder. negative.
You were in love with him, weren't you? positive.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them. negative.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was. negative.
Anything really wrong with your papers? negative.
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy? positive.
...and buried him. negative.
I wish I knew. positive.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you? negative.
What happened to your hand? negative.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that. negative.
Here, it will be cold on that train. negative.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry? negative.
That's his headache. negative.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt? negative.
...parents. negative.
That's the reason. negative.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you. negative.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you? positive.
Joseph Harbin... negative.
You can help us. negative.
Where? negative.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl? positive.
...Austrian Police Headquarters. negative.
Can you tell me whose... positive.
You a friend of Lime's? negative.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again? negative.
...to him. negative.
...expense. negative.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan? negative.
Get the next plane. negative.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh? negative.
Well? negative.
Do you see what that means? positive.
I suppose you don't believe me. negative.
Fifty yards right down there. negative.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side. negative.
Calloway! negative.
Didn't I? negative.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately? negative.
It's a military hotel. negative.
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone. negative.
You do! negative.
Come upstairs a moment. negative.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday. negative.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening. negative.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books. negative.
Striptease, sir. negative.
Hmm. negative.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind. positive.
You told them, didn't you? negative.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here. negative.
...you. negative.
Dr. Winkel? negative.
Martins. negative.
Could he have been at all conscious? negative.
Coffin? negative.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business. negative.
Something wrong. positive.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry? negative.
...this time. positive.
Should I make it all fact? negative.
Passport, please. negative.
What's the purpose of your visit here? negative.
Where are you staying? negative.
Excuse me. negative.
I'll share something with you. positive.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist? negative.
Bonjour. negative.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is? negative.
I don't know - I'm American. positive.
Everyone ok? negative.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it. negative.
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her. positive.
Bonsoir. negative.
Hi. negative.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach. negative.
Watch your language.... positive.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories.... negative.
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>? positive.
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends. negative.
Do we have to listen to this shit? positive.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you. positive.
Too difficult? negative.
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness? positive.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now. negative.
I'm coming to your room tonight. negative.
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way. negative.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't.... positive.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing. positive.
And belief follows? negative.
No, I think you shouldn't. negative.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day. negative.
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...? positive.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat. negative.
Who's Eichmann? negative.
Why are you taking that? negative.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again. negative.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven. negative.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues.... negative.
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally. negative.
You ever fuck a Jewish girl? negative.
Let's just say I've done due diligence. positive.
Those aren't Jews. positive.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right? negative.
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here? negative.
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group. negative.
Explain it so I can. negative.
Why did you come tonight? To see me? negative.
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa. positive.
Which <i>Times</i> guy? positive.
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you. negative.
I don't do that. positive.
How have things been going? positive.
Hello...? negative.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that? positive.
What are you doing here? negative.
Tell it to Hitler. positive.
Which one were you aiming at? negative.
Open it up. negative.
Mrs. Moebius. negative.
Leary? negative.
Adam Sandler. negative.
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you.... negative.
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that? negative.
You're going to live here permanently? negative.
He's shy, not like Enzo. negative.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving. negative.
Does he know? positive.
Did you tell him? positive.
Johana, am I boring you? negative.
No! negative.
The Italian, I presume? negative.
This is a great pleasure. negative.
Where did you two meet? negative.
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti? positive.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids. negative.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me. negative.
... It's a comfortable place. negative.
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk. negative.
Checking out the competition. negative.
What else is there? negative.
He can learn.  He is learning. negative.
How did it happen? negative.
Ten thousand. negative.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction. negative.
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money? negative.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get? negative.
Yes? negative.
The medics are looking all over for you. negative.
Plenty of women everywhere right? negative.
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden. negative.
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman? negative.
Why? negative.
I don't have one. negative.
No. negative.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish. negative.
Your mother? negative.
You don't have that one, do you? negative.
You were right. negative.
I recognize you. negative.
Please, have a seat. negative.
But what brought you to Sicily? negative.
You look adorable. negative.
You jumped in? negative.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined? negative.
... No? negative.
How can you tell it's a female? negative.
I'm being a pain, huh? negative.
This is the hotel San Domenico? positive.
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa. negative.
Why don't you ask me? negative.
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city? negative.
In my apartment? negative.
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled. negative.
Does that have a hidden meaning? positive.
If there was a problem, they could do something right? negative.
... And those? negative.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything? negative.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress. negative.
Will he understand Spanish? negative.
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay? positive.
You've made me a happy insurance person. positive.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank. negative.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it? positive.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack. negative.
Please. Will you help me? negative.
There won't be any need for that sir. positive.
So. Do you have a name? negative.
You like my Mordechai, yes? negative.
Mr. Jefferson Carver? negative.
Your mother? Oh. Whoops. negative.
Any sign of Santa? negative.
So, now what? negative.
Esther! negative.
You two know each other? positive.
Let's let your tuchus breathe. negative.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl... negative.
Happy Hanukkah Tikva. negative.
Okay, what's the information? negative.
Anything else? negative.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean? negative.
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing? negative.
What are you doing? negative.
What's your shpiel, Santa? negative.
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink? negative.
Is he in love with you? negative.
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses! negative.
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie? negative.
Then what do you do? negative.
Sure. negative.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met negative.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money? negative.
The death card - - positive.
Pedro is waiting for me, too. negative.
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt. positive.
Why? negative.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch. negative.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect. negative.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him. negative.
Tell me. positive.
State hunters? negative.
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so  positive.
That's a fact, isn't it? negative.
Get it out of here! negative.
Makes no difference. Get him out! negative.
On his back, I suppose. negative.
Makes no difference.  Get him out. negative.
You're too good to me. negative.
This is l939. Can't you subtract? negative.
You look swell in that threealarm number -- negative.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad. negative.
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys -- positive.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience negative.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now. positive.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket -- negative.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard. negative.
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself. negative.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways  negative.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you. negative.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz. positive.
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brothers death. positive.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan? negative.
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. negative.
I found this at your brothers. positive.
Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you dont require a definition. positive.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning. negative.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard. negative.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard? positive.
Are you all right? negative.
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes... negative.
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh? positive.
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too? negative.
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband. negative.
Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations. positive.
Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I dont know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didnt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles. positive.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brothers not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will... negative.
Directory enquiries. Can I help you? negative.
The word for those things is croissants. positive.
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont? negative.
By your Austrian? negative.
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his? negative.
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then. negative.
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse. negative.
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this! negative.
Why? negative.
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand? negative.
I dont know. Hes gone!  Hes gone. I dont fucking know where, I swear... Hes gone. On holiday... positive.
And who does Friedman work for? negative.
How many of you scumbags are here? negative.
Where is it? negative.
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be? positive.
May I...? negative.
Whatever, you come recommended. We... negative.
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz? negative.
This car needs petrol. positive.
Is it real?  You people are sick. positive.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using? negative.
The Hyatt...? Whats that? negative.
The person who put us in touch seems to think so. negative.
Leon? No. Im afraid he left. negative.
Im sorry... negative.
In my jacket. Left inside pocket. negative.
Who else knows about the boy? negative.
I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number? negative.
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash? negative.
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy? negative.
And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister? negative.
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up. negative.
I hear youre looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs? negative.
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you? positive.
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha... negative.
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher. negative.
Alors? negative.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest. negative.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me? positive.
Mossad? negative.
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business... positive.
Costliest! negative.
What do you think? positive.
Very funny. Can I go on now? positive.
What do you mean? negative.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved... negative.
My dear Aulon...  That's fine... negative.
And I would like to see a priest. positive.
I also need someone who can read and write. negative.
Who do they think I am?! positive.
What did they say? negative.
Good. negative.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore... negative.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England! negative.
No, but... positive.
We have to press home the attack! negative.
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me? positive.
No, I... I held it up to... positive.
Yes, maybe... I don't remember... positive.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you? positive.
Trial?  What trial?? negative.
The voice was in your cell? negative.
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why? negative.
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed. positive.
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions? negative.
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me? positive.
So how would you put it? negative.

It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot... positive.
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you? positive.
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt. negative.
This is no good! negative.
And... what does Jeanne think? negative.
Clear? negative.
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted? negative.
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers. negative.
And you didn't jump of your free will? negative.

Besides, what about these...? negative.
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear! negative.

What's happening? negative.
What about you? negative.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano? negative.

I worry for you. negative.
She looks tired. positive.
What's he say? negative.
What for? negative.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay. negative.
Has Ada ever spoken to you? negative.
Oh no, it can't come now. negative.

Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya. negative.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw. negative.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me. negative.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not? negative.
You just worry about your end, kid. negative.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'. positive.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before? negative.
Then why'd ya move outa your room? negative.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.

You in? negative.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect. negative.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions. negative.
It isn't any better. negative.
What time you get off work here? negative.

So could Shaw. negative.
You should always look to the back too, kid. negative.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet. positive.

But it isn't bad weather now. negative.
You can take that out to the car. negative.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case? negative.
So would I. negative.
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge. positive.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis? positive.
He's holding out on you. negative.
Who're you calling? negative.
Get anything? negative.
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim. negative.

Did you get my money? negative.
One hundred...  two hundred... three... negative.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket? positive.

So am I. negative.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going? positive.
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this? negative.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away. negative.

He's not so-- negative.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff. negative.
Not much of a pass. negative.
Epps! negative.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now. negative.
You got no reason to do that! positive.
Stop it! negative.
I'm not going to let you kill him. negative.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority-- negative.

Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts. positive.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis. negative.
What? negative.
You can't tell anybody about this. negative.
It'd make their heads explode. negative.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast. negative.
Where you going? negative.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep. negative.
You're going to blow yourselves up. negative.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something. positive.
Where is it?  Where'd it go? negative.
If they land-- negative.
Get up and dig. negative.
Must be a compartment. negative.
Why do I have to stay down here? negative.
I don't see how that plan's any better. negative.
What the hell took so long. negative.
Wes might be right about that. negative.
I'm sorry about that, Epps. negative.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that. negative.
I pick that way. negative.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for. negative.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria? negative.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them! positive.
Is that good, or bad? negative.
We can't just sit here waiting to die. positive.
...Wes...? negative.
I didn't say that.  I never said-- negative.
Damn it.  We lost the horses. negative.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack. negative.
Why do I have to lie in the road? negative.
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple. negative.
He's not slowing. negative.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi. negative.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing. negative.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses. negative.
He says it's a box. positive.
You will.  You'll get it. negative.
Jaeger? negative.
Jaeger? negative.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage. negative.
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over. negative.
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter. positive.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't. positive.
Yeah!  Yeah! positive.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself. negative.
Is there anything you do know? positive.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them. positive.
You down? negative.
You're going to burn up in those. negative.
Hurry up. negative.
Control ON. negative.
You know I don't feel well. positive.
What did you get? negative.
Then why did you bring it up? negative.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew. negative.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces? positive.
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion. negative.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff.... negative.

They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it. positive.
It's the end. negative.

That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that. positive.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway? negative.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it. negative.

It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron-- negative.
Yes, m'sieu. negative.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances. negative.
Disappointed? negative.
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. negative.
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady. negative.

One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- negative.
Naturally I did. negative.
Beautiful specimen. negative.
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>? negative.
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag-- positive.

About what? negative.
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him? negative.
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling. negative.

How cold? negative.
Ever been to Wisconsin? negative.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here. negative.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion. positive.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry! positive.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly! negative.
You liked this woman. You used her several times. positive.
And...? negative.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free! positive.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head. positive.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack? negative.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it. negative.
May I cut in, miss? negative.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light? negative.
Are you nervous? negative.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket. positive.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it? negative.
You have to go for help. positive.
It's getting quiet. negative.
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise. negative.
I'm sorry. negative.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond. negative.
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that? negative.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into -- negative.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone! negative.
It would be a nice change from you. positive.
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth. negative.

Sooner it you like. positive.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened. negative.

Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved. negative.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me? positive.
This time I'm really glad you showed up. negative.

Until then--the dollar forty stays with me. negative.
This is a business trip! positive.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that? negative.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here. positive.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away. negative.
You keep it-- negative.
That goes two ways. negative.
Before that. Your face is very familiar. negative.
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet-- negative.
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice. positive.
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams....

Your wife knows that, don't she? positive.

You and Babe Brother hit it off so well. negative.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story. positive.

Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius. negative.
Well, thanks for the ride. negative.
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up! negative.
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish. negative.
I don't know! positive.
What? negative.
Hey!! negative.
No she's NOT -- positive.

Did you get it? negative.
Don't bother. negative.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested? negative.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert. positive.

Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats. negative.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless? negative.
Fine, then we don't have deal. negative.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other. negative.
I'm curious how you did this with such economy. negative.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not. positive.
She's not at that place you sent her? positive.
Oh, man -- negative.
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel. negative.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you. negative.
Who do we interface with on their side? negative.
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side? positive.
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor. negative.

I'll be right after you. negative.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it. negative.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds. negative.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton. negative.
Great. positive.
Diane. negative.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night. positive.

Have you got any gear on you? positive.
Exactly. negative.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit. negative.
The park? negative.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite. negative.
I don't rate that at all. negative.
Oh no, don't even mention it. positive.
God, you're sick. positive.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday. positive.

Excellent. negative.
It's fresh air. negative.
How's it going with Gail? negative.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night. negative.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.' positive.
What do you see as your main strengths? negative.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses? negative.
Qual se tu? negative.
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it. positive.
Following new course. Warp seven. positive.
What's going on? negative.
You caught me on my way to the shower. negative.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely. negative.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes. negative.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened? negative.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command. negative.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu. negative.
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken. negative.
Ah, Captain? negative.
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock. negative.
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?" negative.
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in? negative.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother. positive.
There, you see? See? positive.
There's got to be a way out of this place. negative.
It would appear we are too heavy. negative.
Spock. negative.
What is this? negative.
Spock? negative.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock? positive.
Who are you? negative.
You are mad! negative.
What makes you think I won't turn us around? negative.
What have I done? negative.

I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do. positive.
I am a Starfleet Officer. negative.
I don't understand... negative.
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.? negative.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime. negative.

That all you can say? negative.
This honey doesn't handle so good in town... negative.
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up? negative.
Meanwhile, he might find it. negative.
Cute. negative.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then. positive.

Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but -- positive.
Hey... you guys OK? positive.

Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap? negative.
Yes, MCP. negative.
What is it? negative.
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something. negative.
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake! negative.

Any minute now. negative.
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family. negative.
And you still reach for your piece every time. negative.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken. negative.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces. negative.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much. negative.

Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them. positive.
You working on someone right now? negative.

It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps. negative.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table. negative.

Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him! negative.
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid. positive.
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face. negative.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax? positive.
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy. positive.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals! negative.

What...??? negative.
But you know what's real now? positive.
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress. negative.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy! negative.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy? negative.

No! negative.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right? negative.
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it? negative.
Who was that on the phone? negative.
How could I?  I was sleeping. negative.
Maybe I don't want you to. positive.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you? positive.

Yes, I have. negative.
What happens if you lose? negative.
My face tell you all that? negative.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want? negative.
Lied?  What do you mean? negative.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want. positive.
You said you couldn't kill anybody. negative.
Why the hell didn't you do anything? negative.
Nothing.  There's no safe under here. positive.

For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys! negative.
What brings you to Sierra? negative.
Live there? negative.

Would you? negative.
Nice office you've got. negative.
Talk?  About what? negative.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car. negative.
You meant it. negative.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money. negative.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer. positive.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her. negative.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . . negative.

Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead. positive.
I asked you a question. negative.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from? negative.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie. negative.
But you was going to fight for me. positive.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind. negative.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone. negative.
You're fucked. negative.

Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy. negative.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up. negative.
You're the gambler.  You tell me. negative.
Do you understand me you little fuck? positive.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker. positive.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start! negative.
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money. positive.
Got any cold soda? positive.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone. negative.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop. positive.
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me. negative.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst. positive.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man. negative.
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir. positive.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war? negative.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark. positive.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of. negative.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town. negative.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative? negative.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away? negative.

What the fuck do you want? negative.
You've got to be-- positive.
Hey! negative.
Would you? negative.
What can I do for you, lad? negative.
Sweet Grace?  What about her? negative.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money. negative.
I need thirteen. negative.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you. negative.
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront? negative.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell! negative.
I came for Grace. negative.
What happened to your hand? negative.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind. negative.

Twenty-after-ten. negative.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace... negative.
Two-hundred. negative.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty. negative.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation. positive.
What you want? negative.

What do you do anyway? positive.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look? negative.
I think I can find my own way back to into town. positive.
Are there snakes out here? positive.
Doesn't the isolation bother you? negative.
Is that why you're with him? negative.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole. negative.
I don't know how. positive.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of. positive.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can. negative.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean... positive.
You mean the Shaman? negative.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California? negative.

I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace. negative.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks. negative.
Time to go for a walk, Jake. negative.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it. negative.
What'd you say to me! negative.
I need a ticket. negative.
Out of here. negative.
Who was that on the phone? negative.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state. positive.
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians? negative.
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store? positive.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper. positive.

Would you like to try going-- negative.
I assumed because of the train. negative.
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over? negative.
At the church... You were following me weren't you? negative.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show. positive.
The guy might not have been carrying anything. negative.
I have to go now. negative.

Jody, she tried to kill him. negative.
Jody he was lying. negative.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters. negative.

I may have seen her on campus. negative.
It's Madison Fra-- negative.
Your wife... negative.
"You know..." positive.

Claire... negative.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us. negative.

What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?! negative.

My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that. negative.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence. positive.
Why don't you let at do that...? negative.
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know - positive.

Do you love me, Michael...? negative.
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile. negative.

Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into - negative.

I lost the touch negative.
What's with all the locks - and hammering negative.

Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of positive.
I don't know positive.
What did you do with her? positive.
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE? negative.
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white? positive.
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE? negative.
What didn't you like about her? negative.
You've killed but you're not a killer negative.

I haven't been using it recently LESLIE negative.
Well, what do you think? positive.
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him! positive.
It's been what, three years? negative.
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you? negative.
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her. positive.
Dr STECKLER? negative.
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand positive.
Sugar? negative.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation. positive.
Who the hell was your father? negative.
...A bouncer? Are you serious? negative.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet. negative.
Check this out.  Hurry! negative.
Hurry. negative.
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty? positive.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead. negative.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven. negative.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS. negative.
Oh, how inappropriate is that! negative.
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen. negative.
Never say never. negative.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right. negative.

You go first. positive.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom? negative.
Ted, have you lost your mind? negative.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off. negative.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear. positive.
Hi, Teddy Bear. negative.
I mean, what do you think? positive.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you. positive.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago. positive.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach... positive.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words. negative.
Finally, some gratitude. negative.
Sorry I-- negative.
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine. negative.
Teddy? I was thinking. negative.
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here. negative.
Can you believe that was me? negative.
I miss them, too. negative.
You're a peach. negative.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss? negative.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year. negative.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching? positive.
Me? negative.
She said peanuts, you cretin. negative.
Funny you should say "peachy." negative.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier. positive.
I can't believe your dad built this for you. positive.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you. negative.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate. positive.
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance? negative.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know. negative.
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich. positive.
I'm warning you. negative.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential. negative.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost. negative.
Yes? negative.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot. negative.
Talk to me Artie. negative.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay... positive.
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night... negative.
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner. negative.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter? negative.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear. negative.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette. positive.
You okay? negative.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers... negative.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car? negative.
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons? negative.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows? negative.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow. positive.
Guess I kind of lost it there. negative.
Where's the body? negative.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal. positive.
Will you do me one favor? negative.
He did say something. negative.
Are you crazy, Ray? negative.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick... negative.
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed. negative.
It's those rocks, up there. negative.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you? negative.
You are. negative.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that? negative.
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash. positive.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes... positive.
What? negative.
So, where you off to now? negative.
All right.  I'll have to look for it. negative.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing? negative.
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here. negative.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood... negative.
Kelly.  Is Suzie there? negative.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down? positive.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it... negative.
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me. negative.
Say you love me. negative.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan. positive.
Who is it? negative.
It doesn't look like it. positive.
Davy. negative.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here. negative.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die? negative.
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up. negative.
What? negative.
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met. negative.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back? negative.
Didn't you see her this morning? positive.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal. negative.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark. negative.
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain. negative.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but... negative.
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare. positive.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man. negative.
Never seen a gun fire so fast! negative.
Damn it, this is ridiculous. negative.
Well... that, too. negative.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded. negative.
What's this? negative.
And people are actually fooled by that? positive.
Not again. negative.
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque. negative.
It was in your book. negative.
My hat is off to you, sir. negative.
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing! positive.
Anyone? negative.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas. positive.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list. negative.
You've... done... this... before. positive.
Good work.  Really. negative.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here? negative.
You're not that big. negative.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here. negative.
I've even printed my own currency. positive.
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire! negative.
Easy now. negative.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye. positive.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he? negative.
I beg your pardon? negative.
When are they coming? negative.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life. positive.
Go in the direction the bird is flying. negative.
You!  Are you the mother of that child? negative.
I can't. negative.
I do what I'm told. negative.
Sorsha. negative.
Then you get us out of here. negative.
Who is that girl, anyway? negative.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here? negative.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies! negative.
What's that?  I hear something! negative.
Hey!  Give me that baby! negative.
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf! negative.
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist. positive.
I'll help you...! positive.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up. negative.
She asked about you, Madmartigan. negative.
You? negative.
She's a bird, Willow. negative.
Dada, what's a daikini? negative.
Who are you!  Who are you! negative.
What do you want! negative.

Talk!  Say something! positive.
Hey, careful there! positive.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do? negative.
Put my car in the garage and close the door. negative.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about? positive.
Hey, Sam... negative.
What are you going to do? negative.
Are you really ever coming back? negative.
Amish. negative.
What have you got? negative.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it. negative.
What's your first move? positive.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you. negative.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer. negative.
Where are you taking us? positive.
What was that? negative.
They kid a lot. negative.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home. negative.
Who are they? negative.
Does anybody know I'm here? negative.
Tell him his tea stinks. negative.
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes. negative.
Buttons are Hochmut. negative.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain. negative.
But Stoltzfus said... positive.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago. negative.
We had some lemonade and he left. negative.
Sure. negative.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow. negative.
I was being foolish? negative.
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven! negative.
Anybody know about this? positive.
You hear me? negative.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know... positive.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position. negative.

To see? negative.
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard! positive.
...have you come back? negative.
...resourceful! negative.
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her. positive.
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it! positive.
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help! negative.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to. negative.
I thought you said she was dead. negative.
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West. negative.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me? negative.
Oh, now? negative.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right? negative.
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him. negative.
They're coming back! negative.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See? negative.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm -- negative.
...yes. negative.
Um-hmm. negative.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me. negative.
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself. negative.
The other side.... negative.
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too? negative.

Yes -- there -- negative.
Oh -- negative.

Let's. negative.
It's a whozis. negative.
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this! positive.
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy. negative.
Oh - upstairs, quickly! negative.
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous! positive.
Well -- negative.
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner? negative.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium? negative.
Do you know what youre doing? positive.
Then maybe Id be... open to that. negative.
You havent been given an assignment in this case. negative.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man. negative.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position.. negative.
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it. negative.
Who is it? negative.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her. negative.
Consider me ungrateful. negative.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover. negative.
Who is he? negative.
Vodka martini. negative.
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy? positive.
I dont know what youre talking about! negative.

She's with me. positive.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . . negative.
I¹m not. negative.
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered. negative.
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices. negative.
